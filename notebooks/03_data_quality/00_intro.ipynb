    "In this data profiling exercise, the aim is to evaluate the reliability, validity, format, type and structure of the dataset vis-a-vis the objectives and methods of this study. We will be examining the data through six data quality dimensions:\n",
    "1. Completeness: Is all necessary data present?\n",
    "2. Validity: Are all data values within specified value domains?\n",
    "3. Integrity: Are the relations between entities and attributes consistent?\n",
    "4. Timeliness: Is the data available at the time needed?\n",
    "5. Consistency: Is the data consistent between systems? Do duplicate records exist?\n",
    "6. Accuracy: Does data correctly reflect real-world objects?\n",

    "The package comprises three datasets as described in the previous section, and are:\n",
