@techreport{RecommendationSystems,
	title = {Recommendation {Systems}},
	abstract = {There is an extensive class of Web applications that involve predicting user responses to options. Such a facility is called a recommendation system. We shall begin this chapter with a survey of the most important examples of these systems. However, to bring the problem into focus, two good examples of recommendation systems are: 1. Offering news articles to on-line newspaper readers, based on a prediction of reader interests. 2. Offering customers of an on-line retailer suggestions about what they might like to buy, based on their past history of purchases and/or product searches. Recommendation systems use a number of different technologies. We can classify these systems into two broad groups. • Content-based systems examine properties of the items recommended. For instance, if a Netflix user has watched many cowboy movies, then recommend a movie classified in the database as having the "cowboy" genre. • Collaborative filtering systems recommend items based on similarity measures between users and/or items. The items recommended to a user are those preferred by similar users. This sort of recommendation system can use the groundwork laid in Chapter 3 on similarity search and Chapter 7 on clustering. However, these technologies by themselves are not sufficient , and there are some new algorithms that have proven effective for recommendation systems. 9.1 A Model for Recommendation Systems In this section we introduce a model for recommendation systems, based on a utility matrix of preferences. We introduce the concept of a "long-tail," 319},

	doi = {10.475/123},
	abstract = {In the last decade new ways of shopping online have increased the possibility of buying products and services more easily and faster than ever. In this new context, personality is a key determinant in the decision making of the consumer when shopping. The two main reasons are: firstly, a person's buying choices are influenced by psychological factors like impulsiveness, and secondly, some consumers may be more susceptible to making impulse purchases than others. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of personality factors on advertisements has been largely neglected at the level of recommender systems. This work proposes a highly innovative research which uses a personality perspective to determine the unique associations among the consumer's buying tendency and advert recommendations. As a matter of fact, the lack of a publicly available benchmark for computational advertising do not allow both the exploration of this intriguing research direction and the evaluation of state-of-the-art algorithms. We present the ADS Dataset, a publicly available benchmark for computational advertising enriched with Big-Five users' personality factors and 1,200 personal users' pictures. The proposed benchmark allows two main tasks: rating prediction over 300 real advertisements (i.e., Rich Media Ads, Image Ads, Text Ads) and click-through rate prediction. Moreover, this work carries out experiments, reviews various evaluation criteria used in the literature, and provides a library for each one of them within one integrated toolbox.},

Although a lot of job recommender systems exist that uses different strategies , here efforts have been put to make the job recommendations on the basis of candidate's profile matching as well as preserving candidate's job behavior or preferences. Firstly, rules predicting the general preferences of the different user groups are mined. Then the job recommendations to the target candidate are made on the basis of content based matching as well as candidate preferences, which are preserved either in the form of mined rules or obtained by candidate's own applied jobs history. Through this technique a significant level of accuracy has been achieved over other basic methods of job recommendations.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a content-based recommender system which proposes jobs to Facebook and LinkedIn users. A variant of this recommender system is currently used by Work4, a San Francisco-based software company that offers Facebook recruitment solutions. Work4 is the world leader in social recruitment technology; to use its applications, Facebook or LinkedIn users explicitly grant access to some parts of their data, and they are presented with the jobs whose descriptions are matching their profiles the most. The profile of a user contains two types of data: interactions data (user's own data) and social connections data (user's friends data). Furthermore the users profiles and the description of jobs are divided into several parts called fields. Our experiments suggest that to predict the users interests for jobs, using basic similarity measures together with their interactions data collected by Work4 can be improved upon. The second part of this study presents a method to estimate the importance of each field of users and jobs in the task of job recommendation. Finally, the third part is devoted to the use of a machine learning algorithm in order to improve the results obtained with similarity measures: we trained a linear SVM (Support Vector Machines). Our results show that using this supervised learning procedure increases the performance of our contentbased recommender system. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

	abstract = {Coordination failure reduces match quality among employers and candidates in the job market, resulting in a large number of unflled positions and/or unstable, short-term employment. Centralized job search engines provide a platform that connects directly employers with job-seekers. However, they require users to disclose a signifcant amount of personal data, i.e., build a user profle, in order to provide meaningful recommendations. In this paper, we present PrivateJobMatch - a privacy-oriented deferred multi-match recommender system - which generates stable pairings while requiring users to provide only a partial ranking of their preferences. PrivateJobMatch explores a series of adaptations of the game-theoretic Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm which combine the fexibility of decentralized markets with the intelligence of centralized matching. We identify the shortcomings of the original algorithm when applied to a job market and propose novel solutions that rely on machine learning techniques. Experimental results on real and synthetic data confrm the benefts of the proposed algorithms across several quality measures. Over the past year, we have implemented a PrivateJobMatch prototype and deployed it in an active job market economy. Using the gathered real-user preference data, we fnd that the match recommendations are superior to a typical decentralized job market-while requiring only a partial ranking of the user preferences.},

Big Data can be defined as high volume, velocity and variety of data that require a new high-performance processing. Addressing big data is a challenging and time-demanding task that requires a large computational infrastructure to ensure successful data processing and analysis. The presence of data preprocessing methods for data mining in big data is reviewed in this paper. The definition, characteristics, and categorization of data preprocessing approaches in big data are introduced. The connection between big data and data preprocessing throughout all families of methods and big data technologies are also examined, including a review of the state-of-the-art. In addition, research challenges are discussed, with focus on developments on different big data framework, such as Hadoop, Spark and Flink and the encouragement in devoting substantial research efforts in some families of data preprocessing methods and applications on new big data learning paradigms.},

	abstract = {In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.},

However, studies show that fewer than 5\% of cancer patients are enrolled in any type of research study or clinical trial. Although there is a wide variety of reasons for the low participation rate, we address this issue by designing a chatbot to help users determine their eligibility via interactive, two-way communication. The chatbot is supported by a user-centered classifier that uses an active deep learning approach to separate complex eligibility criteria into questions that can be easily answered by users and information that requires verification by their doctors. We collected all the available clinical trial eligibility criteria from the National Cancer Institute's website to evaluate the chatbot and the classifier. Experimental results show that the active deep learning classifier outperforms the baseline k-nearest neighbor method. In addition, an in-person experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the chatbot. The results indicate that the participants who used the chatbot achieved better understanding about eligibility than those who used only the website. Furthermore, interfaces with chatbots were rated significantly better in terms of perceived usability, interactivity, and dialogue.},

With the great success of deep learning in many fields, there is an emerging trend to deploy deep learning on mobile and embedded devices to better meet the requirement of real-time applications and user privacy protection. However, the limited resources of mobile and embedded devices make it challenging to fulfill the intensive computation and storage demand of deep learning models. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review on the related issues for deep learning on mobile and embedded devices. We start with a brief introduction of deep learning and discuss major challenges of implementing deep learning models on mobile and embedded devices. We then conduct an in-depth survey on important compression and acceleration techniques that help adapt deep learning models to mobile and embedded devices, which we specifically classify as pruning, quantization, model distillation, network design strategies, and low-rank factorization. We elaborate on the hardware-based solutions, including mobile GPU, FPGA, and ASIC, and describe software frameworks for mobile deep learning models, especially the development of frameworks based on OpenCL and RenderScript. After that, we present the application of mobile deep learning in a variety of areas, such as navigation, health, speech recognition, and information security. Finally, we discuss some future directions for deep learning on mobile and embedded devices to inspire further research in this area.},

The goal of price prediction is to help sellers set effective and reasonable prices for their second-hand items with the images and text descriptions uploaded to the online platforms. Specifically, we design a multi-modal price suggestion system which takes as input the extracted visual and textual features along with some statistical item features collected from the second-hand item shopping platform to determine whether the image and text of an uploaded second-hand item are qualified for reasonable price suggestion with a binary classification model, and provide price suggestions for second-hand items with qualified images and text descriptions with a regression model. To satisfy different demands, two different constraints are added into the joint training of the classification model and the regression model. Moreover, a customized loss function is designed for optimizing the regression model to provide price suggestions for second-hand items, which can not only maximize the gain of the sellers but also facilitate the online transaction. We also derive a set of metrics to better evaluate the proposed price suggestion system. Extensive experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-modal price suggestion system.},

	abstract = {In modern online advertising systems, the click-through rate (CTR) is an important index to measure the popularity of an item. It refers to the ratio of users who click on a specific advertisement to the number of total users who view it. Predicting the CTR of an item in advance can improve the accuracy of the advertisement recommendation. And it is commonly calculated based on users’ interests. Thus, extracting users’ interests is of great importance in CTR prediction tasks. In the literature, a lot of studies treat the interaction between users and items as sequential data and apply the recurrent neural network (RNN) model to extract users’ interests. However, these solutions cannot handle the case when the sequence length is relatively long, e.g., over 100. This is because of the vanishing gradient problem of RNN, i.e., the model cannot learn a users’ previous behaviors that are too far away from the current moment. To address this problem, we propose a new Core Interest Network (CIN) model to mitigate the problem of a long sequence in the CTR prediction task with sequential data. In brief, we first extract the core interests of users and then use the refined data as the input of subsequent learning tasks. Extensive evaluations on real dataset show that our CIN model can outperform the state-of-the-art solutions in terms of prediction accuracy.},

	abstract = {Click-through rate prediction plays an important role in many fields, such as recommender and advertising systems. It is one of the crucial parts to improve user experience and increase industry revenue. Recently, several deep learning-based models are successfully applied to this area. Some existing studies further model user representation based on user historical behavior sequence, in order to capture dynamic and evolving interests. We observe that users usually have multiple interests at a time and the latent dominant interest is expressed by the behavior. The switch of latent dominant interest results in the behavior changes. Thus, modeling and tracking latent multiple interests would be beneficial. In this paper, we propose a novel method named as Deep Multi-Interest Network (DMIN) which models user’s latent multiple interests for click-through rate prediction task. Specifically, we design a Behavior Refiner Layer using multi-head self-attention to capture better user historical item representations. Then the Multi-Interest Extractor Layer is applied to extract multiple user interests. We evaluate our method on three real-world datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed DMIN outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines in terms of click-through rate prediction task.},

	abstract = {Traditional recommendation systems estimate user preference on items from past interaction history, thus suffering from the limitations of obtaining fine-grained and dynamic user preference. Conversational recommendation system (CRS) brings revolutions to those limitations by enabling the system to directly ask users about their preferred attributes on items. However, existing CRS methods do not make full use of such advantage — they only use the attribute feedback in rather implicit ways such as updating the latent user representation. In this paper, we propose Conversational Path Reasoning (CPR), a generic framework that models conversational recommendation as an interactive path reasoning problem on a graph. It walks through the attribute vertices by following user feedback, utilizing the user preferred attributes in an explicit way. By leveraging on the graph structure, CPR is able to prune off many irrelevant candidate attributes, leading to better chance of hitting user preferred attributes. To demonstrate how CPR works, we propose a simple yet effective instantiation named SCPR (Simple CPR). We perform empirical studies on the multi-round conversational recommendation scenario, the most realistic CRS setting so far that considers multiple rounds of asking attributes and recommending items. Through extensive experiments on two datasets Yelp and LastFM, we validate the effectiveness of our SCPR, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CRS methods EAR [13] and CRM [24]. In particular, we find that the more attributes there are, the more advantages our method can achieve.},

Such a model is highly relevant for study sponsors to capture risk and opportunity on a trial to trial basis through trial optimization, and for investors to select drugs whose trial design match their investment strategy.
Objectives: To predict the outcome of planned or ongoing PhIII trials in oncology, given publicly available prior information
Design, Setting, Participants: Predictive modeling using publicly available data for 360 completed PhIII and 1240 PhII studies initiated between 2003 and 2012. Success and failure of PhIII studies were modeled using Bayesian logistic regression model.
Main Outcome Measures: Predicted PoS of individual PhIII trials based on a Bayesian model calibrated on publicly available data translated into 16 composite scores. Those scores cover aspects such as trial design, indication, number of patients, phase II (PhII) study outcomes, experience of sponsor at time of trial initiation, and others.
Results: The model allows to calculate the PoS distribution,  including credible intervals, for a PhIII trial in oncology. The predictive performance was determined using an area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC), resulting in an overall performance of 73\%oPP (mean AUROC). We identified two key factors contributing to the predictive performance of the model: quality and strength of PhII data and experience of the sponsor at the time of study initiation. 
Conclusion and Relevance: We describe the generation and application of a statistical model predicting the PoS for individual PhIII trials in oncological indications with unprecedented predictive performance. Compared to other approaches, this is the first study generating a fully transparent model resulting in trial specific PoS distributions. Moreover, we have shown that qualitative concepts such as PhII knowledge or sponsor R\&D strength can be captured in quantitative scores and that these scores have a high predictive power.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE Drug development in oncology currently is facing a conjunction of an increasing number of antineoplastic agents (ANAs) candidate for phase I clinical trials (P1CTs) and an important attrition rate for ﬁnal approval. We aimed to develop a machine learning algorithm (RESOLVED2) to predict drug development outcome, which could support early go/no-go decisions after P1CTs by better selection of drugs suitable for further development.
METHODS PubMed abstracts of P1CTs reporting on ANAs were used together with pharmacologic data from the DrugBank5.0 database to model time to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval (FDA approval-free survival) since the ﬁrst P1CT publication. The RESOLVED2 model was trained with machine learning methods. Its performance was evaluated on an independent test set with weighted concordance index (IPCW).
RESULTS We identiﬁed 462 ANAs from PubMed that matched with DrugBank5.0 (P1CT publication dates 1972 to 2017). Among 1,411 variables, 28 were used by RESOLVED2 to model the FDA approval-free survival, with an IPCW of 0.89 on the independent test set. RESOLVED2 outperformed a model that was based on efﬁcacy/toxicity (IPCW, 0.69). In the test set at 6 years of follow-up, 73\% (95\% CI, 49\% to 86\%) of drugs predicted to be approved were approved, whereas 92\% (95\% CI, 87\% to 98\%) of drugs predicted to be nonapproved were still not approved (log-rank P , .001). A predicted approved drug was 16 times more likely to be approved than a predicted nonapproved drug (hazard ratio, 16.4; 95\% CI, 8.40 to 32.2).
CONCLUSION As soon as P1CT completion, RESOLVED2 can predict accurately the time to FDA approval. We provide the proof of concept that drug development outcome can be predicted by machine learning strategies.},

We found that the selected heuristics were useful with good coverage in our application case. However, based on our observations, we argue that interaction, veracity, and aesthetics related heuristics should be added to the previously used set. The lack of domain knowledge made the evaluators somewhat uneasy with their capability to carry out the investigation in-depth. We suggest to train domain experts with understanding of the data and application domain to carry out the evaluation to get insightful feedback beyond usability issues.},

By combining a custom developed messaging bus with a web service implementation, a dynamic, interactive immersive environment is provided across a number of platforms including CAVEs, touch tables, single wall displays, and desktops. We provide an architecture discussion including driver capabilities to enable quick development of additional data sources with existing visualization applications. We conclude with a discussion of several projects that successfully utilize the framework for real-time big data and geospatial applications for a range of tasks.

Such design decisions are inﬂuenced not only by visualization theory, but also by the people and context of the research. While existing applied visualization models support a level of reliability throughout the design process, they fail to explicitly account for the inﬂuence of the research context in shaping the resulting design artifacts. In this work, we look to action design research (ADR) for insight into addressing this issue. In particular, ADR oﬀers a framework along with a set of guiding principles for navigating and capitalizing on the disruptive, subjective, human-centered nature of applied design work, while aiming to ensure reliability of the process and design, and emphasizing opportunities for conducting research. We explore the utility of ADR in increasing the reliability of applied visualization design research by: describing ADR in the language and constructs developed within the visualization community; comparing ADR to existing visualization methodologies; and analyzing a recent design study retrospectively through the lens of ADR’s framework and principles.},

This method constructs multiple drug and target similarity networks and applies the GraRep algorithm on the similarity networks after denoising in order to extract the features. Features obtained from heterogeneous networks are combined as a feature vector of DTIs, which is the input of Random Forest. The result of our experiment shows that our method in this paper increases the accuracy of prediction for DTIs, which is superior to other state-of-the-art approaches.},

	abstract = {Clinical trials are crucial for the advancement of treatment and knowledge within the medical community. Since 2007, US federal government took the initiative and required organizations sponsoring clinical trials with at least one site in the United States to submit information on these clinical trials to the ClinicalTrials.gov database, resulting in a rich source of information for clinical trial research. Nevertheless, only a handful of analytic studies have been carried out to understand this valuable data source. In this study, we propose to use network analysis to understand infectious disease clinical trial research. Our goal is to answer two important questions: (1) what are the concentrations and characteristics of infectious disease clinical trial research? and (2) how to accurately predict what type of clinical trials a sponsor (or an investigator) are interested in? The answers to the first question provide effective ways to summarize clinical trial research related to particular disease(s), and the answers to the second question help match clinical trial sponsors and investigators for information recommendation. By using 4,228 clinical trials as the test bed, our study involves 4,864 sponsors and 1,879 research areas characterized by Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) keywords. We extract a set of network measures to show patterns of infectious disease clinical trials, and design a new community based link prediction approach to predict sponsors’ interests, with significant improvement compared to baselines. This trans-formative study concludes that using network analysis can tremendously help the understanding of clinical trial research for effective summarization, characterization, and prediction.},

            Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully used in many applications where important information about data is embedded in the order of features, such as speech and imaging. However, most tabular data do not assume a spatial relationship between features, and thus are unsuitable for modeling using CNNs. To meet this challenge, we develop a novel algorithm, image generator for tabular data (IGTD), to transform tabular data into images by assigning features to pixel positions so that similar features are close to each other in the image. The algorithm searches for an optimized assignment by minimizing the difference between the ranking of distances between features and the ranking of distances between their assigned pixels in the image. We apply IGTD to transform gene expression profiles of cancer cell lines (CCLs) and molecular descriptors of drugs into their respective image representations. Compared with existing transformation methods, IGTD generates compact image representations with better preservation of feature neighborhood structure. Evaluated on benchmark drug screening datasets, CNNs trained on IGTD image representations of CCLs and drugs exhibit a better performance of predicting anti-cancer drug response than both CNNs trained on alternative image representations and prediction models trained on the original tabular data.},

To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efﬁcient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overﬁtting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

	abstract = {To fully exploit the advantages of massive multiple-input multiple-output (m-MIMO), accurate channel state information (CSI) is required at the transmitter. However, excessive CSI feedback for large antenna arrays is inefﬁcient and thus undesirable in practical applications. By exploiting the inherent correlation characteristics of complex-valued channel responses in the angulardelay domain, we propose a novel neural network (NN) architecture, namely ENet, for CSI compression and feedback in m-MIMO. Even if the ENet processes the real and imaginary parts of the CSI values separately, its special structure enables the network trained for the real part only to be reused for the imaginary part. The proposed ENet shows enhanced performance with the network size reduced by nearly an order of magnitude compared to the existing NN-based solutions. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed ENet.},

	abstract = {A key driver in biopharmaceutical investment decisions is the probability of success of a drug development program. We estimate the probabilities of success (PoS) of clinical trials for vaccines and other anti-infective therapeutics using 43,414 unique triplets of clinical trial, drug, and disease between January 1, 2000, and January 7, 2020, yielding 2,544 vaccine programs and 6,829 non-vaccine programs targeting infectious diseases. The overall estimated PoS for an industry-sponsored vaccine program is 39.6\%, and 16.3\% for an industry-sponsored anti-infective therapeutic. Among industry-sponsored vaccines programs, only 12 out of 27 disease categories have seen at least one approval, with the most successful being against monkeypox (100\%), rotavirus (78.7\%), and Japanese encephalitis (67.6\%). The three infectious diseases with the highest PoS for industry-sponsored nonvaccine therapeutics are smallpox (100\%), CMV (31.8\%), and onychomycosis (29.8\%). Nonindustry-sponsored vaccine and non-vaccine development programs have lower overall PoSs: 6.8\% and 8.2\%, respectively. Viruses involved in recent outbreaks—MERS, SARS, Ebola, Zika—have had a combined total of only 45 non-vaccine development programs initiated over the past two decades, and no approved therapy to date (Note: our data was obtained just before the COVID-19 outbreak and do not contain information about the programs targeting this disease.) These estimates offer guidance both to biopharma investors as well as to policymakers seeking to identify areas most likely to be undeserved by private-sector engagement and in need of public-sector support.},

Our regression analysis showed that studies with progression-free survival or response rate as primary endpoint were more likely to succeed than studies with overall survival (odds ratio (OR)=2.94 and 6.23, respectively). The status of development was also linked with success rates. Studies for non-lead indication tended to have lower success rates than studies for lead indication (OR=0.68). Studies for first-line therapy were observed to have low success rates compared with studies for post second-line therapies (OR=0.37). Studies for which strong prior evidence was not listed in their publication tended to be more successful than studies that followed rigorous RCTs or single arm studies for the indication. These results suggest that historical success rates may reflect not only the important features of trials, which can be observed directly from study design and results, but also the background status of trials in clinical development pathways.},

	abstract = {The current success rate of a drug candidate, from the beginning of the clinical trial to receiving marketing approval, is about 10\%–2­ 0\%, and it has not changed during the past few decades. Therefore, pharmaceutical companies are under pressure to select one compound, among many others, with a high probability of success. The differences in drug features affect their probabilities of approval success. In this study, we examined the approval success rates of drug candidates, developed in the United States, the European Union, or Japan, by focusing on four parameters (“drug target,” “drug action,” “drug modality,” and “drug application”) and their combinations, and identified factors that conditioned the outcome of the drug development process. We obtained a total success rate of 12.8\%, after evaluating 3999 compounds. Moreover, after analyzing the combinations of these parameters, the approval success rates of drugs that corresponded to the following categories—­a stimulant in drug action or an enzyme in drug target and biologics (excluding monoclonal antibody) in drug modality—­were high (34.1\% and 31.3\%, respectively). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that stimulant in drug action, and “B” (blood and blood forming organs), “G” (genito-u­ rinary system and sex), and “J” (anti-i­nfectives for systemic use) in drug application were statistically associated with high approval success rates. We found several parameters and their combinations that affected drug approval success rates. Our results could assist pharmaceutical companies in evaluating the probability of success of their drug candidates and, thus, in efficiently conducting the clinical development process.},

The simulation model utilizes available data about each drug/indication in the industry R\&D pipeline, and transforms it into a set of metrics characterizing future industry performance. Industry-wide portfolio simulation model was developed to address short- and longterm portfolio productivity forecasting challenges. The model is drug–centric, it simulates drug development work ow process. The model also incorporates multiple business rules related to drugs interdependence. The model predicted 2016 drop in NME approvals based on 2014 data.

	abstract = {Background:  Studies on the early 2000s documented increasing attrition rates and duration of clinical trials, leading to a representation of a “productivity crisis” in pharmaceutical research and development (R\&D). In this paper, we produce a new set of analyses for the last decade and report a recent increase of R\&D productivity within the industry.
Methods:  We use an extensive data set on the development history of more than 50,000 projects between 1990 and 2017, which we integrate with data on sales, patents, and anagraphical information on each institution involved. We devise an indicator to quantify the novelty of each project, based on its set of mechanisms of action.
Results:  First, we investigate how R\&D projects are allocated across therapeutic areas and find a polarization towards high uncertainty/high potential reward indications, with a strong focus on oncology. Second, we find that attrition rates have been decreasing at all stages of clinical research in recent years. In parallel, for each phase, we observe a significant reduction of time required to identify projects to be discontinued. Moreover, our analysis shows that more recent successful R\&D projects are increasingly based on novel mechanisms of action and target novel indications, which are characterized by relatively small patient populations. Third, we find that the number of R\&D projects on advanced therapies is also growing. Finally, we investigate the relative contribution to productivity variations of different types of institutions along the drug development process, with a specific focus on the distinction between the roles of Originators and Developers of R\&D projects. We document that in the last decade Originator–Developer collaborations in which biotech companies act as Developers have been growing in importance. Moreover, we show that biotechnology companies have reached levels of productivity in project development that are equivalent to those of large pharmaceutical companies.
Conclusions:  Our study reports on the state of R\&D productivity in the bio-pharmaceutical industry, finding several signals of an improving performance, with R\&D projects becoming more targeted and novel in terms of indications and mechanisms of action.},

	abstract = {Deep learning revolutionized data science, and recently its popularity has grown exponentially, as did the amount of papers employing deep networks. Vision tasks, such as human pose estimation, did not escape from this trend. There is a large number of deep models, where small changes in the network architecture, or in the data pre-processing, together with the stochastic nature of the optimization procedures, produce notably different results, making extremely difﬁcult to sift methods that signiﬁcantly outperform others. This situation motivates the current study, in which we perform a systematic evaluation and statistical analysis of vanilla deep regression, i.e. convolutional neural networks with a linear regression top layer. This is the ﬁrst comprehensive analysis of deep regression techniques. We perform experiments on four vision problems, and report conﬁdence intervals for the median performance as well as the statistical signiﬁcance of the results, if any. Surprisingly, the variability due to different data pre-processing procedures generally eclipses the variability due to modiﬁcations in the network architecture. Our results reinforce the hypothesis according to which, in general, a general-purpose network (e.g. VGG-16 or ResNet-50) adequately tuned can yield results close to the state-of-the-art without having to resort to more complex and ad-hoc regression models.},

In particular, we discuss k-LinReg, a straightforward and easy to implement algorithm in the spirit of k-means for the nonconvex optimization problem at the core of switched linear regression, and focus on the question of its accuracy on large data sets and its ability to reach global optimality. To this end, we emphasize the relationship between the sample size and the probability of obtaining a local minimum close to the global one with a random initialization. This is achieved through the estimation of a model of the behavior of this probability with respect to the problem dimensions. This model can then be used to tune the number of restarts required to obtain a global solution with high probability. Experiments show that the model can accurately predict the probability of success and that, despite its simplicity, the resulting algorithm can outperform more complicated approaches in both speed and accuracy.},

We show that maximum margin methods such as boosted trees and boosted stumps push probability mass away from 0 and 1 yielding a characteristic sigmoid shaped distortion in the predicted probabilities. Models such as Naive Bayes, which make unrealistic independence assumptions, push probabilities toward 0 and 1. Other models such as neural nets and bagged trees do not have these biases and predict well calibrated probabilities. We experiment with two ways of correcting the biased probabilities predicted by some learning methods: Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression. We qualitatively examine what kinds of distortions these calibration methods are suitable for and quantitatively examine how much data they need to be effective. The empirical results show that after calibration boosted trees, random forests, and SVMs predict the best probabilities.},

	abstract = {Modern deep learning methods have equipped researchers and engineers with incredibly powerful tools to tackle problems that previously seemed impossible. However, since deep learning methods operate as black boxes, the uncertainty associated with their predictions is often challenging to quantify. Bayesian statistics offer a formalism to understand and quantify the uncertainty associated with deep neural networks predictions. This paper provides a tutorial for researchers and scientists who are using machine learning, especially deep learning, with an overview of the relevant literature and a complete toolset to design, implement, train, use and evaluate Bayesian neural networks.

	abstract = {Predicting Phase 3 clinical trial results is a critical step of Go/No-Go decision making and Phase 3 trial design optimization. To predict the overall treatment eﬀect for patients enrolled into a Phase 3 trial, we propose a framework consisting of two models. First, an individual trough pharmacokinetic concentration (Ctrough) model is developed to predict the trough pharmacokinetic concentration for a potentially new treatment regime planned for Phase 3. Second, an individual treatment eﬀect model is built to model the relationship between patient baseline characteristics, Ctrough and clinical outcomes. These two models are combined together to predict Phase 3 clinical trial results. Since the clinical outcomes to be predicted are longitudinal and the predictors are a mix of time-invariant and timevariant variables, a novel neural network, Residual Semi-Recurrent Neural Network, is developed for both models. The proposed framework is applied in a post-hoc prediction of Phase 3 clinical trial results, and it outperforms the traditional method.},

However, the literature on the cost of pharmaceutical R\&D is mixed on how, exactly, one should calculate this “hidden” cost. Some authors attempt to adopt models from the field of finance, whereas other prominent authors dismiss this practice as biased, arguing that it artificially inflates the R\&D cost to justify higher prices for pharmaceuticals. In this article, we examine the arguments made by both sides of the debate and then explain the cost of capital concept and describe in detail how this value is calculated. Given the significant contribution of the cost of capital to the overall cost of new drug R\&D, a clear understanding of the concept is critical for policy makers, investors, and those involved directly in the R\&D.},

We find that clinical trial phase transitions can be predicted with an average accuracy of 80\%. Identifying these trials provides information to sponsors facing difficult decisions about whether these higher risk trials should be modified or halted. We also find common protocol characteristics across therapeutic areas that are linked to phase success, including the number of endpoints and the complexity of the eligibility criteria.},

            DrugCentral is a public resource (http://drugcentral.org) that serves the scientific community by providing up-to-date drug information, as described in previous papers. The current release includes 109 newly approved (October 2018 through March 2020) active pharmaceutical ingredients in the US, Europe, Japan and other countries; and two molecular entities (e.g. mefuparib) of interest for COVID19. New additions include a set of pharmacokinetic properties for ∼1000 drugs, and a sex-based separation of side effects, processed from FAERS (FDA Adverse Event Reporting System); as well as a drug repositioning prioritization scheme based on the market availability and intellectual property rights forFDA approved drugs. In the context of the COVID19 pandemic, we also incorporated REDIAL-2020, a machine learning platform that estimates anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities, as well as the ‘drugs in news’ feature offers a brief enumeration of the most interesting drugs at the present moment. The full database dump and data files are available for download from the DrugCentral web portal.},

Storytellers, especially online journalists, have increasingly been integrating visualizations into their narratives, in some cases allowing the visualization to function in place of a written story. In this paper, we systematically review the design space of this emerging class of visualizations. Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research, we identify distinct genres of narrative visualization. We characterize these design differences, together with interactivity and messaging, in terms of the balance between the narrative ﬂow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration). Our framework suggests design strategies for narrative visualization, including promising under-explored approaches to journalistic storytelling and educational media.},

	abstract = {The goal of the research described in this paper is to develop an application-independent presentation tool that automatically designs effective graphical presentations (such as bar charts, scatter plots, and connected graphs) of relational information. Two problems are raised by this goal: The codification of graphic design criteria in a form that can be used by the presentation tool, and the generation of a wide variety of designs so that the presentation tool can accommodate a wide variety of information. The approach described in this paper is based on the view that graphical presentations are sentences of graphical languages. The graphic design issues are codified as expressiveness and effectiveness criteria for graphical languages. Expressiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language can express the desired information. Effectiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language exploits the capabilities of the output medium and the human visual system. A wide variety of designs can be systematically generated by using a composition algebra that composes a small set of primitive graphical languages. Artificial intelligence techniques are used to implement a prototype presentation tool called APT (A Presentation Tool), which is based on the composition algebra and the graphic design criteria.},

Current research often assumes a one-shot interaction paradigm, where the users’ preferences are estimated based on past observed behavior and where the presentation of a ranked list of suggestions is the main, one-directional form of user interaction. Conversational recommender systems (CRS) take a different approach and support a richer set of interactions. These interactions can, for example, help to improve the preference elicitation process or allow the user to ask questions about the recommendations and to give feedback. The interest in CRS has significantly increased in the past few years. This development is mainly due to the significant progress in the area of natural language processing, the emergence of new voice-controlled home assistants, and the increased use of chatbot technology. With this article, we provide a detailed survey of existing approaches to conversational recommendation. We categorize these approaches in various dimensions, e.g., in terms of the supported user intents or the knowledge they use in the background. Moreover, we discuss technological approaches, review how CRS are evaluated, and finally identify a number of gaps that deserve more research in the future.},

Recommend systems based on different algorithms as one of the basic ways to reach this goal through the internet have been proposed but each of them has their own advantages and disadvantages. In this study, we have selected and implemented two approaches which are Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Social Network Recommendations System (SNRS). Based on some limitations to finding a dataset which covers friendship, rating and item categories we generated it for 10 categories, 10 items, and 100 users and compared two approaches. We used Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and accuracy to compare the result of two mentioned approaches and found that the SNRS method as it is claimed to be improved version of CF works more efficiency.},

Recently, providing explanations about why items are recommended has attracted increasing attention due to its capability to enhance user trust and satisfaction. In this paper, we propose a co-attentive multitask learning model for explainable recommendation. Our model improves both prediction accuracy and explainability of recommendation by fully exploiting the correlations between the recommendation task and the explanation task. In particular, we design an encoder-selector-decoder architecture inspired by human’s information-processing model in cognitive psychology. We also propose a hierarchical co-attentive selector to effectively model the cross knowledge transferred for both tasks. Our model not only enhances prediction accuracy of the recommendation task, but also generates linguistic explanations that are ﬂuent, useful, and highly personalized. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.},

	abstract = {A personalized conversational sales agent could have much commercial potential. E-commerce companies such as Amazon, eBay, JD, Alibaba etc. are piloting such kind of agents with their users. However, the research on this topic is very limited and existing solutions are either based on single round adhoc search engine or traditional multi round dialog system. They usually only utilize user inputs in the current session, ignoring users’ long term preferences. On the other hand, it is well known that sales conversion rate can be greatly improved based on recommender systems, which learn user preferences based on past purchasing behavior and optimize business oriented metrics such as conversion rate or expected revenue. In this work, we propose to integrate research in dialog systems and recommender systems into a novel and unified deep reinforcement learning framework to build a personalized conversational recommendation agent that optimizes a per session based utility function.},

Even though DAs are able to complete tasks such as sending texts, making phone calls, or playing songs, they do not yet implement recommendation facilities. In this paper, we investigate the combination of Digital Assistants and Conversational Recommender Systems (CoRSs) by designing and implementing a framework named ConveRSE (Conversational Recommender System framEwork), for building chatbots that can recommend items from different domains and interact with the user through natural language. Since a CoRS architecture is generally composed of different elements, we performed an in-vitro experiment with two synthetic datasets, to investigate the impact that each component has on the CoRS in terms of recommendation accuracy. Additionally, an in-vivo experiment was carried out to understand how natural language influences both the cost of interaction and recommendation accuracy of a CoRS. Experimental results have revealed the most critical components in a CoRS architecture, especially in cold-start situations, and the main issues of the natural-language-based interaction. All the dialogues have been collected in a public available dataset.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems have been attracting much attention from both academia and industry because of their ability to capture user interests and generate personalized item recommendations. As the life pace in contemporary society speeds up, traditional recommender systems are inevitably limited by their disconnected interaction styles and low adaptivity to users’ evolving demands. Consequently, conversational recommender systems emerge as a prospective research area, where an intelligent dialogue agent is integrated with a recommender system. Conversational recommender systems possess the ability to accurately understand end-users’ intent or request and generate human-like dialogue responses when performing recommendations. However, existing conversational recommender systems only allow the systems to ask users for more preference information, while users’ further questions and concerns about the recommended items (e.g., enquiring the location of a recommended restaurant) can hardly be addressed. Though the recent task-oriented dialogue systems allow for two-way communications, they are not easy to train because of their high dependence on human guidance in terms of user intent recognition and system response generation. Hence, to enable two-way human-machine communications and tackle the challenges brought by manually crafted rules, we propose Conversational Recommender System with Adversarial Learning (CRSAL), a novel end-to-end system to tackle the task of conversational recommendation. In CRSAL, we innovatively design a fully statistical dialogue state tracker coupled with a neural policy agent to precisely capture each user’s intent from limited dialogue data and generate conversational recommendation actions. We further develop an adversarial Actor-Critic reinforcement learning approach to adaptively refine the quality of generated system actions, thus ensuring coherent human-like dialogue responses. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets fully demonstrate the superiority of CRSAL on conversational recommendation tasks.},

	abstract = {Providing explanations for recommended items not only allows users to understand the reason for receiving recommendations but also provides users with an opportunity to re�ne recommendations by critiquing undesired parts of the explanation. While much research focuses on improving the explanation of recommendations, less e�ort has focused on interactive recommendation by allowing a user to critique explanations. Aside from traditional constraint- and utility-based critiquing systems, the only end-to-end deep learning based critiquing approach in the literature so far, CE-VNCF, su�ers from unstable and ine�cient training performance. In this paper, we propose a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) based critiquing system to mitigate these issues and improve overall performance. The proposed model generates keyphrase-based explanations of recommendations and allows users to critique the generated explanations to re�ne their personalized recommendations. Our experiments show promising results: (1) The proposed model is competitive in terms of general performance in comparison to state-of-the-art recommenders, despite having an augmented loss function to support explanation and critiquing. (2) The proposed model can generate high-quality explanations compared to user or item keyphrase popularity baselines. (3) The proposed model is more e�ective in re�ning recommendations based on critiquing than CE-VNCF, where the rank of critiquing-a�ected items drops while general recommendation performance remains stable. In summary, this paper presents a signi�cantly improved method for multi-step deep critiquing based recommender systems based on the VAE framework.},

The utility of recommender systems cannot be overstated, given its widespread adoption in many web applications, along with its potential impact to ameliorate many problems related to over-choice. In recent years, deep learning has garnered considerable interest in many research fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, owing not only to stellar performance but also the attractive property of learning feature representations from scratch. The influence of deep learning is also pervasive, recently demonstrating its effectiveness when applied to information retrieval and recommender systems research. Evidently, the field of deep learning in recommender system is flourishing. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of recent research efforts on deep learning based recommender systems. More concretely, we provide and devise a taxonomy of deep learning based recommendation models, along with providing a comprehensive summary of the state-of-the-art.

	abstract = {For better user satisfaction and business effectiveness, Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is one of the most important tasks in Ecommerce. It is often the case that users’ interests different from their past routines may emerge or impressions such as promotional items may burst in a very short period. In essence, such changes relate to item evolution problem, which has not been investigated by previous studies. The state-of-the-art methods in the sequential recommendation, which use simple user behaviors, are incapable of modeling these changes sufficiently. It is because, in the user behaviors, outdated interests may exist and the popularity of an item over time is not well represented. To address these limitations, we introduce time-aware item behaviors for addressing the recommendation of emerging preference. The time-aware item behavior for an item is a set of users who interact with this item with timestamps. The rich interaction information of users for an item may help to model its evolution. In this work, we propose a CTR prediction model TIEN based on the time-aware item behavior. In TIEN, by leveraging the interaction time intervals, information of similar users in a short time interval helps identify the emerging user interest of the target user. By using the sequential time intervals, the item’s popularity over time can be captured in evolutionary item dynamics. Noisy users who interact with items accidentally are further eliminated thus learning robust personalized item dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to the item evolution problem for E-commerce CTR prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world CTR prediction datasets. The results show that the TIEN model consistently achieves remarkable improvements to the state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {In this paper we describe a method for computing item based recommendations using matrix-factorization-like embeddings of the items computed using a neural network. Matrix factorizations (MF) compute near optimal item embeddings by minimizing a loss that measures the discrepancy between the predicted and known values of a sparse user-item rating matrix. Though useful for recommendation tasks, they are computationally intensive and hard to compute for large sets of users and items. Hence there is need to compute MF-like embeddings using other less computationally intensive methods, which can be substituted for the actual ones. In this work we explore the possibility of doing the same using a deep neural network (DNN). Our network is trained to learn matrix-factorizationlike embeddings from easy to compute natural language processing (NLP) based semantic embeddings. The resulting MF-like embeddings are used to compute recommendations using an anonymized user product engagement dataset from the online retail company Overstock.com. We present the results of using our embeddings for computing recommendations with the Overstock.com production dataset consisting of ∼3.5 million items and ∼6 million users. Recommendations from Overstock.com’s own recommendation system is compared against those obtained by using our MF-like embeddings, by comparing the results from both to the ground truth, which in our case is actual user co-clicks data. Our results show that it is possible to use DNNs for efficiently computing MFlike embeddings which can then be used in conjunction with the NLP based embeddings to improve the recommendations obtained from the NLP based embeddings.},

This paper addresses both challenges in the context of constraintbased recommenders where users specify their requirements and the system recommends a solution. We propose a novel approach to determine value ordering heuristics on the basis of matrix factorization. As far as we are aware, no researches exist in constraint-based recommendation domain which exploit matrix factorization techniques. The main idea of our approach consists in the prediction of value ordering heuristics based on historical transactions which can either represent past customer purchases or requirements. Thereby, value ordering heuristics are computed which are specific to each user’s requirements. A series of experiments on real-world datasets for calculating constraint-based recommendations has shown that our approach outperforms compared methods in terms of runtime efficiency and prediction quality.},

	abstract = {Product feature recommendations are critical for online customers to purchase the right products based on the right features. For a customer, selecting the product that has the best trade-off between price and functionality is a time-consuming step in an online shopping experience, and customers can be overwhelmed by the available choices. However, determining the set of product features that most differentiate a particular product is still an open question in online recommender systems. In this paper, we focus on using interpretable machine learning methods to tackle this problem. First, we identify this unique product feature recommendation problem from a business perspective on a major US e-commerce site. Second, we formulate the problem into a price-driven supervised learning problem to discover the product features that could best explain the price of a product in a given product category. We build machine learning models with a model-agnostic method Shapley Values to understand the importance of each feature, rank and recommend the most essential features. Third, we leverage human experts to evaluate its relevancy. The results show that our method is superior to a strong baseline method based on customer behavior and significantly boosts the coverage by 45\%. Finally, our proposed method shows comparable conversion rate against the baseline in online A/B tests.},

	abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) is a common recommendation approach that relies on user-item ratings. However, the natural sparsity of user-item rating data can be problematic in many domains and settings, limiting the ability to generate accurate predictions and effective recommendations. Moreover, in some CF approaches latent features are often used to represent users and items, which can lead to a lack of recommendation transparency and explainability. User-generated, customer reviews are now commonplace on many websites, providing users with an opportunity to convey their experiences and opinions of products and services. As such, these reviews have the potential to serve as a useful source of recommendation data, through capturing valuable sentiment information about particular product features. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning recommendation model, which co-learns user and item information from ratings and customer reviews, by optimizing matrix factorization and an attention-based GRU network. Using real-world datasets we show a significant improvement in recommendation performance, compared to a variety of alternatives. Furthermore, the approach is useful when it comes to assigning intuitive meanings to latent features to improve the transparency and explainability of recommender systems.},

	abstract = {Reviews information is dominant for users to make online purchasing decisions in e-commerces. However, the usefulness of reviews is varied. We argue that less-useful reviews hurt model’s performance, and are also less meaningful for user’s reference. While some existing models utilize reviews for improving the performance of recommender systems, few of them consider the usefulness of reviews for recommendation quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel attention mechanism to explore the usefulness of reviews, and propose a Neural Attentional Regression model with Review-level Explanations (NARRE) for recommendation. Speci cally, NARRE can not only predict precise ratings, but also learn the usefulness of each review simultaneously. Therefore, the highly-useful reviews are obtained which provide review-level explanations to help users make better and faster decisions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets of Amazon and Yelp on di erent domains show that the proposed NARRE model consistently outperforms the state-ofthe-art recommendation approaches, including PMF, NMF, SVD++, HFT, and DeepCoNN in terms of rating prediction, by the proposed attention model that takes review usefulness into consideration. Furthermore, the selected reviews are shown to be e ective when taking existing review-usefulness ratings in the system as ground truth. Besides, crowd-sourcing based evaluations reveal that in most cases, NARRE achieves equal or even better performances than system’s usefulness rating method in selecting reviews. And it is exible to o er great help on the dominant cases in real ecommerce scenarios when the ratings on review-usefulness are not available in the system.},

	abstract = {Recently, many e-commerce websites have encouraged their users to rate shopping items and write review texts. This review information has been very useful for understanding user preferences and item properties, as well as enhancing the capability to make personalized recommendations of these websites. In this paper, we propose to model user preferences and item properties using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with dual local and global attention, motivated by the superiority of CNNs to extract complex features. By using aggregated review texts from a user and aggregated review text for an item, our model can learn the unique features (embedding) of each user and each item. These features are then used to predict ratings. We train these user and item networks jointly which enable the interaction between users and items in a similar way as matrix factorization. The local attention provides us insight on a user’s preferences or an item’s properties. The global attention helps CNNs focus on the semantic meaning of the whole review text. Thus, the combined local and global attentions enable an interpretable and better-learned representation of users and items. We validate the proposed models by testing on popular review datasets in Yelp and Amazon and compare the results with matrix factorization (MF), the hidden factor and topical (HFT) model, and the recently proposed convolutional matrix factorization (ConvMF+). Our proposed CNNs with dual attention model outperforms HFT and ConvMF+ in terms of mean square errors (MSE). In addition, we compare the user/item embeddings learned from these models for classi cation and recommendation. These results also con rm the superior quality of user/item embeddings learned from our model.},

	abstract = {Background Missed vascular events, infections, and cancers account for {\textasciitilde}75\% of serious harms from diagnostic errors. Just 15 diseases from these “Big Three” categories account for nearly half of all serious misdiagnosis-related harms in malpractice claims. As part of a larger project estimating total US burden of serious misdiagnosis-related harms, we performed a focused literature review to measure diagnostic error and harm rates for these 15 conditions. Methods We searched PubMed, Google, and cited references. For errors, we selected high-quality, modern, US-based studies, if available, and best available evidence otherwise. For harms, we used literature-based estimates of the generic (disease-agnostic) rate of serious harms (morbidity/mortality) per diagnostic error and applied claims-based severity weights to construct disease-specific rates. Results were validated via expert review and comparison to prior literature that used different methods. We used Monte Carlo analysis to construct probabilistic plausible ranges (PPRs) around estimates. Results Rates for the 15 diseases were drawn from 28 published studies representing 91,755 patients. Diagnostic error (false negative) rates ranged from 2.2\% (myocardial infarction) to 62.1\% (spinal abscess), with a median of 13.6\% [interquartile range (IQR) 9.2–24.7] and an aggregate mean of 9.7\% (PPR 8.2–12.3). Serious misdiagnosis-related harm rates per incident disease case ranged from 1.2\% (myocardial infarction) to 35.6\% (spinal abscess), with a median of 5.5\% (IQR 4.6–13.6) and an aggregate mean of 5.2\% (PPR 4.5–6.7). Rates were considered face valid by domain experts and consistent with prior literature reports. Conclusions Diagnostic improvement initiatives should focus on dangerous conditions with higher diagnostic error and misdiagnosis-related harm rates.},

Cloud computing in healthcare can potentially help increase the quality of healthcare delivery and reduce the economic burden, enabling governments to address healthcare challenges effectively and within a short timeframe. Advanced Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Singapore provide successful examples of how cloud computing can be used to develop nationwide databases of electronic health records; real-time health monitoring for the elderly population; genetic database to support advanced research and cancer treatment; telemedicine; and health cities that drive the economy through medical industry, tourism, and research.

While promising, we demonstrate that existing approaches struggle (in terms of both quality and content) to generate justiﬁcations that are relevant to users’ decision-making process. We seek to introduce new datasets and methods to address this recommendation justiﬁcation task. In terms of data, we ﬁrst propose an ‘extractive’ approach to identify review segments which justify users’ intentions; this approach is then used to distantly label massive review corpora and construct largescale personalized recommendation justiﬁcation datasets. In terms of generation, we design two personalized generation models with this data: (1) a reference-based Seq2Seq model with aspect-planning which can generate justiﬁcations covering different aspects, and (2) an aspect-conditional masked language model which can generate diverse justiﬁcations based on templates extracted from justiﬁcation histories. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets which show that our model is capable of generating convincing and diverse justiﬁcations.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems are now popular both commercially and in the research community, where many approaches have been suggested for providing recommendations. In many cases a system designer that wishes to employ a recommendation system must choose between a set of candidate approaches. A ﬁrst step towards selecting an appropriate algorithm is to decide which properties of the application to focus upon when making this choice. Indeed, recommendation systems have a variety of properties that may affect user experience, such as accuracy, robustness, scalability, and so forth. In this paper we discuss how to compare recommenders based on a set of properties that are relevant for the application. We focus on comparative studies, where a few algorithms are compared using some evaluation metric, rather than absolute benchmarking of algorithms. We describe experimental settings appropriate for making choices between algorithms. We review three types of experiments, starting with an ofﬂine setting, where recommendation approaches are compared without user interaction, then reviewing user studies, where a small group of subjects experiment with the system and report on the experience, and ﬁnally describe large scale online experiments, where real user populations interact with the system. In each of these cases we describe types of questions that can be answered, and suggest protocols for experimentation. We also discuss how to draw trustworthy conclusions from the conducted experiments. We then review a large set of properties, and explain how to evaluate systems given relevant properties. We also survey a large set of evaluation metrics in the context of the property that they evaluate.},

Boole considers language not just as a mode of expression, but as a system one can use to understand the human mind. In the first 12 chapters, he sets down the rules necessary to represent logic in this unique way. Then he analyses a variety of arguments and propositions of various writers from Aristotle to Spinoza. One of history's most insightful mathematicians, Boole is compelling reading for today's student of intellectual history and the science of the mind.},

	abstract = {The collaborative filtering method is widely used in the traditional recommendation system. The collaborative filtering method based on matrix factorization treats the user’s preference for the item as a linear combination of the user and the item latent vectors, and cannot learn a deeper feature representation. In addition, the cold start and data sparsity remain major problems for collaborative filtering. To tackle these problems, some scholars have proposed to use deep neural network to extract text information, but did not consider the impact of long-distance dependent information and key information on their models. In this paper, we propose a neural collaborative filtering recommender method that integrates user and item auxiliary information. This method fully integrates user-item rating information, user assistance information and item text assistance information for feature extraction. First, Stacked Denoising Auto Encoder is used to extract user features, and Gated Recurrent Unit with auxiliary information is used to extract items’ latent vectors, respectively. The attention mechanism is used to learn key information when extracting text features. Second, the latent vectors learned by deep learning techniques are used in multi-layer nonlinear networks to learn more abstract and deeper feature representations to predict user preferences. According to the verification results on the MovieLens data set, the proposed model outperforms other traditional approaches and deep learning models making it state of the art.},

The research presented in this paper was carried out as follows: the data was pre-processed, before being converted from text to vector representation using a range of feature extraction techniques such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, Glove, and word2vec. We study the performance of different machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, stochastic gradient descent, naive Bayes and convolutional neural networks. In addition, we evaluate our models using accuracy, F1score, precision, recall and log loss function. Moreover, we apply Lime technique to provide analytical reasons for the reviews being classiﬁed as either positive, negative or neutral.

In comparison to traditional machine learning methods such as decision trees and support vector machines, deep learning methods have achieved substantial improvement in various prediction tasks. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) are comparably weak in explaining their inference processes and ﬁnal results, and they are typically treated as a black-box by both developers and users. Some people even consider DNNs (deep neural networks) in the current stage rather as alchemy, than as real science. In many real-world applications such as business decision, process optimization, medical diagnosis and investment recommendation, explainability and transparency of our AI systems become particularly essential for their users, for the people who are aﬀected by AI decisions, and furthermore, for the researchers and developers who create the AI solutions. In recent years, the explainability and explainable AI have received increasing attention by both research community and industry. This paper ﬁrst introduces the history of Explainable AI, starting from expert systems and traditional machine learning approaches to the latest progress in the context of modern deep learning, and then describes the major research areas and the state-ofart approaches in recent years.

Our training data includes only sentences labeled with their attribute (e.g., positive or negative), but not pairs of sentences that differ only in their attributes, so we must learn to disentangle attributes from attributeindependent content in an unsupervised way. Previous work using adversarial methods has struggled to produce high-quality outputs. In this paper, we propose simpler methods motivated by the observation that text attributes are often marked by distinctive phrases (e.g., “too small”). Our strongest method extracts content words by deleting phrases associated with the sentence’s original attribute value, retrieves new phrases associated with the target attribute, and uses a neural model to ﬂuently combine these into a ﬁnal output. On human evaluation, our best method generates grammatical and appropriate responses on 22\% more inputs than the best previous system, averaged over three attribute transfer datasets: altering sentiment of reviews on Yelp, altering sentiment of reviews on Amazon, and altering image captions to be more romantic or humorous.},

	abstract = {Undirected neural sequence models such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) have received renewed interest due to their success on discriminative natural language understanding tasks such as questionanswering and natural language inference. The problem of generating sequences directly from these models has received relatively little attention, in part because generating from undirected models departs signiﬁcantly from conventional monotonic generation in directed sequence models. We investigate this problem by proposing a generalized model of sequence generation that uniﬁes decoding in directed and undirected models. The proposed framework models the process of generation rather than the resulting sequence, and under this framework, we derive various neural sequence models as special cases, such as autoregressive, semi-autoregressive, and reﬁnementbased non-autoregressive models. This uniﬁcation enables us to adapt decoding algorithms originally developed for directed sequence models to undirected sequence models. We demonstrate this by evaluating various handcrafted and learned decoding strategies on a BERT-like machine translation model (Lample \& Conneau, 2019). The proposed approach achieves constant-time translation results on par with linear-time translation results from the same undirected sequence model, while both are competitive with the state-of-theart on WMT’14 English-German translation.},

	abstract = {We introduce a stochastic graph-based method for computing relative importance of textual units for Natural Language Processing. We test the technique on the problem of Text Summarization (TS). Extractive TS relies on the concept of sentence salience to identify the most important sentences in a document or set of documents. Salience is typically deﬁned in terms of the presence of particular important words or in terms of similarity to a centroid pseudo-sentence. We consider a new approach, LexRank, for computing sentence importance based on the concept of eigenvector centrality in a graph representation of sentences. In this model, a connectivity matrix based on intra-sentence cosine similarity is used as the adjacency matrix of the graph representation of sentences. Our system, based on LexRank ranked in ﬁrst place in more than one task in the recent DUC 2004 evaluation. In this paper we present a detailed analysis of our approach and apply it to a larger data set including data from earlier DUC evaluations. We discuss several methods to compute centrality using the similarity graph. The results show that degree-based methods (including LexRank) outperform both centroid-based methods and other systems participating in DUC in most of the cases. Furthermore, the LexRank with threshold method outperforms the other degree-based techniques including continuous LexRank. We also show that our approach is quite insensitive to the noise in the data that may result from an imperfect topical clustering of documents.},

Traditional natural language generation methods rely extensively on hand-crafted rules and predeﬁned templates. This paper presents an attention-enhanced attribute-to-sequence model to generate product reviews for given attribute information, such as user, product, and rating. The attribute encoder learns to represent input attributes as vectors. Then, the sequence decoder generates reviews by conditioning its output on these vectors. We also introduce an attention mechanism to jointly generate reviews and align words with input attributes. The proposed model is trained end-to-end to maximize the likelihood of target product reviews given the attributes. We build a publicly available dataset for the review generation task by leveraging the Amazon book reviews and their metadata. Experiments on the dataset show that our approach outperforms baseline methods and the attention mechanism significantly improves the performance of our model.},

	abstract = {Existing recommender systems in the e-commerce domain primarily focus on generating a set of relevant items as recommendations; however, few existing systems utilize underlying item attributes as a key organizing principle in presenting recommendations to users. Mining important attributes of items from customer perspectives and presenting them along with item sets as recommendations can provide users more explainability and help them make better purchase decision. In this work, we generalize the attribute-aware item-set recommendation problem, and develop a new approach to generate sets of items (recommendations) with corresponding important attributes (explanations) that can best justify why the items are recommended to users. In particular, we propose a system that learns important attributes from historical user behavior to derive item set recommendations, so that an organized view of recommendations and their attribute-driven explanations can help users more easily understand how the recommendations relate to their preferences. Our approach is geared towards real world scenarios: we expect a solution to be scalable to billions of items, and be able to learn item and attribute relevance automatically from user behavior without human annotations. To this end, we propose a multi-step learning-based framework called Extract-Expect-Explain (EX3), which is able to adaptively select recommended items and important attributes for users. We experiment on a large-scale realworld benchmark and the results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an 11.35\% increase on NDCG with adaptive explainability for item set recommendation.},

While fairly successful, these methods usually do not produce highly coherent aspects. In this paper, we present a novel neural approach with the aim of discovering coherent aspects. The model improves coherence by exploiting the distribution of word co-occurrences through the use of neural word embeddings. Unlike topic models which typically assume independently generated words, word embedding models encourage words that appear in similar contexts to be located close to each other in the embedding space. In addition, we use an attention mechanism to de-emphasize irrelevant words during training, further improving the coherence of aspects. Experimental results on real-life datasets demonstrate that our approach discovers more meaningful and coherent aspects, and substantially outperforms baseline methods on several evaluation tasks.},

	abstract = {Review based recommendation utilizes both users’ rating records and the associated reviews for recommendation. Recently, with the rapid demand for explanations of recommendation results, reviews are used to train the encoder–decoder models for explanation text generation. As most of the reviews are general text without detailed evaluation, some researchers leveraged auxiliary information of users or items to enrich the generated explanation text. Nevertheless, the auxiliary data is not available in most scenarios and may suffer from data privacy problems. In this article, we argue that the reviews contain abundant semantic information to express the users’ feelings for various aspects of items, while these information are not fully explored in current explanation text generation task. To this end, we study how to generate more fine-grained explanation text in review based recommendation without any auxiliary data. Though the idea is simple, it is non-trivial since the aspect is hidden and unlabeled. Besides, it is also very challenging to inject aspect information for generating explanation text with noisy review input. To solve these challenges, we first leverage an advanced unsupervised neural aspect extraction model to learn the aspect-aware representation of each review sentence. Thus, users and items can be represented in the aspect space based on their historical associated reviews. After that, we detail how to better predict ratings and generate explanation text with the user and item representations in the aspect space. We further dynamically assign review sentences which contain larger proportion of aspect words with larger weights to control the text generation process, and jointly optimize rating prediction accuracy and explanation text generation quality with a multi-task learning framework. Finally, extensive experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model for both recommendation accuracy and explainability.},

Recently, explainable recommendation has attracted much attention from research community. However, trade-off exists between explainability and performance of the recommendation where metadata is often needed to alleviate the dilemma. We present a novel feature mapping approach that maps the uninterpretable general features onto the interpretable aspect features, achieving both satisfactory accuracy and explainability in the recommendations by simultaneous minimization of rating prediction loss and interpretation loss. To evaluate the explainability, we propose two new evaluation metrics speciﬁcally designed for aspect-level explanation using surrogate ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate a strong performance in both recommendation and explaining explanation, eliminating the need for metadata. Code is available from https://github.com/pd90506/AMCF.},

The prosperity of online campaigns is a challenge in online marketing and is usually evaluated by user response through different metrics, such as clicks on advertisement (ad) creatives, subscriptions to products, purchases of items, or explicit user feedback through online surveys. Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in the number of studies using computational approaches, including machine learning methods, for user response prediction. However, existing literature mainly focuses on algorithmic-driven designs to solve specific challenges, and no comprehensive review exists to answer many important questions. What are the parties involved in the online digital advertising eco-systems? What type of data are available for user response prediction? How do we predict user response in a reliable and/or transparent way? In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of user response prediction in online advertising and related recommender applications. Our essential goal is to provide a thorough understanding of online advertising platforms, stakeholders, data availability, and typical ways of user response prediction. We propose a taxonomy to categorize state-of-the-art user response prediction methods, primarily focusing on the current progress of machine learning methods used in different online platforms. In addition, we also review applications of user response prediction, benchmark datasets, and open source codes in the field.},

It is hard to design an appropriate online learning system under these non-identical delay for different types of ads and users. In this paper, we propose to tackle the delayed feedback problem in online advertising by “Following the Prophet” (FTP for short). The key insight is that, if the feedback came instantly for all the logged samples, we could get a model without delayed feedback, namely the “prophet”. Although the prophet cannot be obtained during online learning, we show that we could predict the prophet’s predictions by an aggregation policy on top of a set of multi-task predictions, where each task captures the feedback patterns of different periods. We propose the objective and optimization approach for the policy, and use the logged data to imitate the prophet. Extensive experiments on three real-world advertising datasets show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art baselines.},

	abstract = {Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is one of the most critical tasks for digital display advertising. Commercial systems often require to update models in an online learning manner to catch up with the evolving data distribution. However, conversions usually do not happen immediately after user clicks. This may result in inaccurate labeling, which is called delayed feedback problem. In previous studies, delayed feedback problem is handled either by waiting positive label for a long period of time, or by consuming the negative sample on its arrival and then insert a positive duplicate when conversion happens later. Indeed, there is a trade-off between waiting for more accurate labels and utilizing fresh data, which is not considered in existing works. To strike a balance in this trade-off, we propose Elapsed-Time Sampling Delayed Feedback Model (ES-DFM), which models the relationship between the observed conversion distribution and the true conversion distribution. Then we optimize the expectation of true conversion distribution via importance sampling under the elapsed-time sampling distribution. We further estimate the importance weight for each instance, which is used as the weight of loss function in CVR prediction. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ES-DFM, we conduct extensive experiments on a public data and a private industrial dataset. Experimental results conﬁrm that our method consistently outperforms the previous state-of-the-art results.},

	abstract = {Recommender system, as an essential part of modern e-commerce, consists of two fundamental modules, namely Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) prediction. While CVR has a direct impact on the purchasing volume, its prediction is wellknown challenging due to the Sample Selection Bias (SSB) and Data Sparsity (DS) issues. Although existing methods, typically built on the user sequential behavior path “impression→click→purchase”, is effective for dealing with SSB issue, they still struggle to address the DS issue due to rare purchase training samples. Observing that users always take several purchase-related actions after clicking, we propose a novel idea of post-click behavior decomposition. Specifically, disjoint purchase-related Deterministic Action (DAction) and Other Action (OAction) are inserted between click and purchase in parallel, forming a novel user sequential behavior graph “impression→click→D(O)Action→purchase”. Defining model on this graph enables to leverage all the impression samples over the entire space and extra abundant supervised signals from D(O)Action, which will effectively address the SSB and DS issues together. To this end, we devise a novel deep recommendation model named Elaborated Entire Space Supervised Multi-task Model (𝐸𝑆𝑀2). According to the conditional probability rule defined on the graph, it employs multi-task learning to predict some decomposed sub-targets in parallel and compose them sequentially to formulate the final CVR. Extensive experiments on both offline and online environments demonstrate the superiority of 𝐸𝑆𝑀2 over state-ofthe-art models. The source code and dataset will be released.},

Existing models usually suffer from such scarce and delayed conversion behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework to tackle the two challenges. Speciﬁcally, we extract the pre-trained embedding from impressions/clicks to assist in conversion models and propose an inner/self-attention mechanism to capture the ﬁne-grained personalized product purchase interests from the sequential click data. Besides, to overcome the time-delay issue, we calibrate the delay model by learning dynamic hazard function with the abundant post-click data more in line with the real distribution. Empirical experiments with real-world user behavior data prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

A successful conversion typically has the following sequential events: "exposure → click → conversion". Conventional CVR estimators are trained in the click space, but inference is done in the entire exposure space. They fail to account for the causes of the missing data and treat them as missing at random. Hence, their estimations are highly likely to deviate from the real values by large. In addition, the data sparsity issue can also handicap many industrial CVR estimators which usually have large parameter spaces.},

However, the performance of traditional machine learning models is often impacted due to variations in user and advertiser behavior. For example, search engine traffic for florists usually tends to peak around Valentine’s day, Mother’s day, etc. To overcome, this challenge, in this manuscript we propose three models which are able to incorporate the effects arising due to variations in product demand. The proposed models are a combination of product demand features, specialized data sampling methodologies and ensemble techniques. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed models on datasets obtained from a real-world setting. Our results show that the proposed models more accurately predict the outcome of users interactions with product related advertisements while simultaneously being robust to fluctuations in user and advertiser behaviors.},

The mainstream methods map sparse, high-dimensional categorical features (e.g., user id, item id) into low-dimensional representations with neural networks. Although they have achieved significant advancement in recent years, how to capture user’s diverse interests effectively from past behaviors is still challenging. Recently some works try using attention-based methods to learn the representation from user behavior history adaptively. However, it is insufficient to capture the diversity of user’s interests. As a step forward to improve this goal, we propose a method named Attentive Capsule Network (ACN). It uses Transformers for feature interaction and leverages capsule networks to capture multiple interests from user behavior history. To precisely obtain sequence representation related to the current advertisement, we further design a modified dynamic routing algorithm integrating with an attention mechanism. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ACN with significant improvement over state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, it also offers good explainability when extracting diverse interest points of users from behavior history.},

The methods are based on a wellknown graph embedding framework. We first construct an item graph from users’ behavior history, and learn the embeddings of all items in the graph. The item embeddings are employed to compute pairwise similarities between all items, which are then used in the recommendation process. To alleviate the sparsity and cold start problems, side information is incorporated into the graph embedding framework. We propose two aggregation methods to integrate the embeddings of items and the corresponding side information. Experimental results from offline experiments show that methods incorporating side information are superior to those that do not. Further, we describe the platform upon which the embedding methods are deployed and the workflow to process the billion-scale data in Taobao. Using A/B test, we show that the online Click-Through-Rates (CTRs) are improved comparing to the previous collaborative filtering based methods widely used in Taobao, further demonstrating the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed methods in Taobao’s live production environment.},

Nonetheless, we observe that several purchase-related micro behaviors (𝑖.𝑒., user’s interactions with specific components on the item detail page) can supplement fine-grained cues for CVR prediction. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel CVR prediction method by Hierarchically Modeling both Micro and Macro behaviors (𝐻 𝑀3). Specifically, we first construct a complete user sequential behavior graph to hierarchically represent micro behaviors and macro behaviors as one-hop and two-hop post-click nodes. Then, we embody 𝐻 𝑀3 as a multi-head deep neural network, which predicts six probability variables corresponding to explicit sub-paths in the graph. They are further combined into the prediction targets of four auxiliary tasks as well as the final 𝐶𝑉 𝑅 according to the conditional probability rule defined on the graph. By employing multi-task learning and leveraging the abundant supervisory labels from micro and macro behaviors, 𝐻 𝑀3 can be trained end-to-end and address the SSB and DS issues. Extensive experiments on both offline and online settings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed 𝐻 𝑀3 over representative state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Estimating post-click conversion rate (CVR) accurately is crucial for ranking systems in industrial applications such as recommendation and advertising. Conventional CVR modeling applies popular deep learning methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. However it encounters several task-specific problems in practice, making CVR modeling challenging. For example, conventional CVR models are trained with samples of clicked impressions while utilized to make inference on the entire space with samples of all impressions. This causes a sample selection bias problem. Besides, there exists an extreme data sparsity problem, making the model fitting rather difficult. In this paper, we model CVR in a brand-new perspective by making good use of sequential pattern of user actions, i.e., impression → click → conversion. The proposed Entire Space Multi-task Model (ESMM) can eliminate the two problems simultaneously by i) modeling CVR directly over the entire space, ii) employing a feature representation transfer learning strategy. Experiments on dataset gathered from traffic logs of Taobao’s recommender system demonstrate that ESMM significantly outperforms competitive methods. We also release a sampling version of this dataset to enable future research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first public dataset which contains samples with sequential dependence of click and conversion labels for CVR modeling.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11826},
	abstract = {Estimating post-click conversion rate (CVR) accurately is crucial in E-commerce. However, CVR prediction usually suffers from three major challenges in practice: i) data sparsity: compared with impressions, conversion samples are often extremely scarce; ii) sample selection bias: conventional CVR models are trained with clicked impressions while making inference on the entire space of all impressions; iii) delayed feedback: many conversions can only be observed after a relatively long and random delay since clicks happened, resulting in many false negative labels during training. Previous studies mainly focus on one or two issues while ignoring the others. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network framework ESDF to tackle the above three challenges simultaneously. Unlike existing methods, ESDF models the CVR prediction from a perspective of entire space, and combines the advantage of user sequential behavior pattern and the time delay factor. Speciﬁcally, ESDF utilizes sequential behavior of user actions on the entire space with all impressions to alleviate the sample selection bias problem. By sharing the embedding parameters between CTR and CVR networks, data sparsity problem is greatly relieved. Different from conventional delayed feedback methods, ESDF does not make any special assumption about the delay distribution. We discretize the delay time by day slot and model the probability based on survival analysis with deep neural network, which is more practical and suitable for industrial situations. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. To the best of our knowledge, ESDF is the ﬁrst attempt to unitedly solve the above three challenges in CVR prediction area. More than that, we release a sampling version of industrial dataset to enable the future research, which is the ﬁrst public dataset that comprises impression, click and delayed conversion labels for CVR modeling.},

	abstract = {Predicting conversion rates (CVRs) in display advertising (e.g., predicting the proportion of users who purchase an item (i.e., a conversion) after its corresponding ad is clicked) is important when measuring the effects of ads shown to users and to understanding the interests of the users. There is generally a time delay (i.e., so-called delayed feedback) between the ad click and conversion. Owing to the delayed feedback, samples that are converted after an observation period may be treated as negative. To overcome this drawback, CVR prediction assuming that the time delay follows an exponential distribution has been proposed. In practice, however, there is no guarantee that the delay is generated from the exponential distribution, and the best distribution with which to represent the delay depends on the data. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric delayed feedback model for CVR prediction that represents the distribution of the time delay without assuming a parametric distribution, such as an exponential or Weibull distribution. Because the distribution of the time delay is modeled depending on the content of an ad and the features of a user, various shapes of the distribution can be represented potentially. In experiments, we show that the proposed model can capture the distribution for the time delay on a synthetic dataset, even when the distribution is complicated. Moreover, on a real dataset, we show that the proposed model outperforms the existing method that assumes an exponential distribution for the time delay in terms of conversion rate prediction.},

Predicting this conversion rate is thus essential for estimating the value of an impression and can be achieved via machine learning. One diﬃculty however is that the conversions can take place long after the impression – up to a month – and this delayed feedback hinders the conversion modeling. We tackle this issue by introducing an additional model that captures the conversion delay. Intuitively, this probabilistic model helps determining whether a user that has not converted should be treated as a negative sample – when the elapsed time is larger than the predicted delay – or should be discarded from the training set – when it is too early to tell. We provide experimental results on real traﬃc logs that demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed model.},

While cloud computing is now a well established paradigm for analysing IoT captured data in mobile health applications, on-board analysis of data using AI approaches such as Deep Learning (DL) is gaining significant momentum. This is driven primarily by advances in on-board resources enabling modern mobile devices to execute complex DL models, while also offering improved response time and accuracy for rapid decision-making, and enhanced user privacy. While the number of mobile digital health applications that use IoT and DL is increasing, progress is currently impeded by a lack of framework for profiling and evaluating the performance of DL models on mobile devices. To this end, we propose MobDL, a framework for profiling and evaluating DL models running on smart mobile devices. We present the architecture of this framework and devise a novel evaluation methodology for conducting quantitative comparisons of various DL models running on mobile devices. Three diverse digital health applications using heterogeneous data (e.g. image, time series) are introduced. We conduct extensive experimental evaluations using several DL models that have been developed using the data sets obtained for the three digital health applications to validate the effectiveness of the proposed MobDL framework.},

	abstract = {Diabetes prediction is an important data science application in the social healthcare domain. There exist two main challenges in the diabetes prediction task: data heterogeneity since demographic and metabolic data are of different types, data insufficiency since the number of diabetes cases in a single medical center is usually limited. To tackle the above challenges, we employ gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) to handle data heterogeneity and introduce multi-task learning (MTL) to solve data insufficiency. To this end, Task-wise Split Gradient Boosting Trees (TSGB) is proposed for the multi-center diabetes prediction task. Specifically, we firstly introduce task gain to evaluate each task separately during tree construction, with a theoretical analysis of GBDT’s learning objective. Secondly, we reveal a problem when directly applying GBDT in MTL, i.e., the negative task gain problem. Finally, we propose a novel split method for GBDT in MTL based on the task gain statistics, named task-wise split, as an alternative to standard feature-wise split to overcome the mentioned negative task gain problem. Extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world diabetes dataset and a commonly used benchmark dataset demonstrate TSGB achieves superior performance against several state-of-the-art methods. Detailed case studies further support our analysis of negative task gain problems and provide insightful findings. The proposed TSGB method has been deployed as an online diabetes risk assessment software for early diagnosis.},

	abstract = {In the United States, advances in technology and medical sciences continue to improve the general well-being of the population. With this continued progress, programs such as Medicare are needed to help manage the high costs associated with quality healthcare. Unfortunately, there are individuals who commit fraud for nefarious reasons and personal gain, limiting Medicare’s ability to effectively provide for the healthcare needs of the elderly and other qualifying people. To minimize fraudulent activities, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released a number of “Big Data” datasets for different parts of the Medicare program. In this paper, we focus on the detection of Medicare fraud using the following CMS datasets: (1) Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Physician and Other Supplier (Part B), (2) Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Part D Prescriber (Part D), and (3) Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Referring Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS). Additionally, we create a fourth dataset which is a combination of the three primary datasets. We discuss data processing for all four datasets and the mapping of real-world provider fraud labels using the List of Excluded Individuals and Entities (LEIE) from the Office of the Inspector General. Our exploratory analysis on Medicare fraud detection involves building and assessing three learners on each dataset. Based on the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve performance metric, our results show that the Combined dataset with the Logistic Regression (LR) learner yielded the best overall score at 0.816, closely followed by the Part B dataset with LR at 0.805. Overall, the Combined and Part B datasets produced the best fraud detection performance with no statistical difference between these datasets, over all the learners. Therefore, based on our results and the assumption that there is no way to know within which part of Medicare a physician will commit fraud, we suggest using the Combined dataset for detecting fraudulent behavior when a physician has submitted payments through any or all Medicare parts evaluated in our study.},

Existing work in outlier detection regards being an outlier as a binary property. In this paper, we contend that for many scenarios, it is more meaningful to assign to each object a
              degree
              of being an outlier. This degree is called the
              local outlier factor
              (LOF) of an object. It is
              local
              in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal analysis showing that LOF enjoys many desirable properties. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that LOF can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful, but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding local outliers can be practical.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06558},
	abstract = {One of the challenges in display advertising is that the distribution of features and click through rate (CTR) can exhibit large shifts over time due to seasonality, changes to ad campaigns and other factors. The predominant strategy to keep up with these shifts is to train predictive models continuously, on fresh data, in order to prevent them from becoming stale. However, in many ad systems positive labels are only observed after a possibly long and random delay. These delayed labels pose a challenge to data freshness in continuous training: fresh data may not have complete label information at the time they are ingested by the training algorithm. Naive strategies which consider any data point a negative example until a positive label becomes available tend to underestimate CTR, resulting in inferior user experience and suboptimal performance for advertisers. The focus of this paper is to identify the best combination of loss functions and models that enable large-scale learning from a continuous stream of data in the presence of delayed labels. In this work, we compare 5 different loss functions, 3 of them applied to this problem for the first time. We benchmark their performance in offline settings on both public and proprietary datasets in conjunction with shallow and deep model architectures. We also discuss the engineering cost associated with implementing each loss function in a production environment. Finally, we carried out online experiments with the top performing methods, in order to validate their performance in a continuous training scheme. While training on 668 million in-house data points offline, our proposed methods outperform previous state-of-the-art by 3\% relative cross entropy (RCE). During online experiments, we observed 55\% gain in revenue per thousand requests (RPMq) against naive log loss.},

This work is about compressing vectors over categorical attributes to low-dimension discrete vectors. The current hash-based methods compressing vectors over categorical attributes to low-dimension discrete vectors do not provide any guarantee on the Hamming distances between the compressed representations. Here we present FSketch to create sketches for sparse categorical data and an estimator to estimate the pairwise Hamming distances among the uncompressed data only from their sketches. We claim that these sketches can be used in the usual data mining tasks in place of the original data without compromising the quality of the task. For that, we ensure that the sketches also are categorical, sparse, and the Hamming distance estimates are reasonably precise. Both the sketch construction and the Hamming distance estimation algorithms require just a single-pass; furthermore, changes to a data point can be incorporated into its sketch in an efficient manner. The compressibility depends upon how sparse the data is and is independent of the original dimension -- making our algorithm attractive for many real-life scenarios. Our claims are backed by rigorous theoretical analysis of the properties of FSketch and supplemented by extensive comparative evaluations with related algorithms on some real-world datasets. We show that FSketch is significantly faster, and the accuracy obtained by using its sketches are among the top for the standard unsupervised tasks of RMSE, clustering and similarity search.},

The proposed model, DeepFM, combines the power of factorization machines for recommendation and deep learning for feature learning in a new neural network architecture. Compared to the latest Wide \& Deep model from Google, DeepFM has a shared input to its “wide” and “deep” parts, with no need of feature engineering besides raw features. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of DeepFM over the existing models for CTR prediction, on both benchmark data and commercial data.},

	abstract = {Click-through rate prediction is an essential task in industrial applications, such as online advertising. Recently deep learning based models have been proposed, which follow a similar Embedding\&MLP paradigm. In these methods large scale sparse input features are first mapped into low dimensional embedding vectors, and then transformed into fixed-length vectors in a group-wise manner, finally concatenated together to fed into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to learn the nonlinear relations among features. In this way, user features are compressed into a fixed-length representation vector, in regardless of what candidate ads are. The use of fixed-length vector will be a bottleneck, which brings difficulty for Embedding\&MLP methods to capture user’s diverse interests effectively from rich historical behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel model: Deep Interest Network (DIN) which tackles this challenge by designing a local activation unit to adaptively learn the representation of user interests from historical behaviors with respect to a certain ad. This representation vector varies over different ads, improving the expressive ability of model greatly. Besides, we develop two techniques: mini-batch aware regularization and data adaptive activation function which can help training industrial deep networks with hundreds of millions of parameters. Experiments on two public datasets as well as an Alibaba real production dataset with over 2 billion samples demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approaches, which achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. DIN now has been successfully deployed in the online display advertising system in Alibaba, serving the main traffic.},

How to capture users’ dynamic and evolving interests from their behavior sequences remains a continuous research topic in the CTR prediction. However, most existing studies overlook the intrinsic structure of the sequences: the sequences are composed of sessions, where sessions are user behaviors separated by their occurring time. We observe that user behaviors are highly homogeneous in each session, and heterogeneous cross sessions. Based on this observation, we propose a novel CTR model named Deep Session Interest Network (DSIN) that leverages users’ multiple historical sessions in their behavior sequences. We ﬁrst use self-attention mechanism with bias encoding to extract users’ interests in each session. Then we apply Bi-LSTM to model how users’ interests evolve and interact among sessions. Finally, we employ the local activation unit to adaptively learn the inﬂuences of various session interests on the target item. Experiments are conducted on both advertising and production recommender datasets and DSIN outperforms other stateof-the-art models on both datasets.},

Despite effectiveness, FM can be hindered by its modelling of all feature interactions with the same weight, as not all feature interactions are equally useful and predictive. For example, the interactions with useless features may even introduce noises and adversely degrade the performance. In this work, we improve FM by discriminating the importance of different feature interactions. We propose a novel model named Attentional Factorization Machine (AFM), which learns the importance of each feature interaction from data via a neural attention network. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AFM. Empirically, it is shown on regression task AFM betters FM with a 8.6\% relative improvement, and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning methods Wide\&Deep [Cheng et al., 2016] and DeepCross [Shan et al., 2016] with a much simpler structure and fewer model parameters.

We also proposed a new explanation of FM and FwFM within the FmFM framework, and compared it with the FFM. Besides pruning the cross terms, our model supports field-specific variable dimensions of embedding vectors, which acts as a soft pruning. We also proposed an efficient way to minimize the dimension while keeping the model performance. The FmFM model can also be optimized further by caching the intermediate vectors, and it only takes thousands floating-point operations (FLOPs) to make a prediction. Our experiment results show that it can out-perform the FFM, which is more complex. The FmFM model’s performance is also comparable to DNN models which require much more FLOPs in runtime.},

	abstract = {Click-through rate (CTR) prediction models are common in many online applications such as digital advertising and recommender systems. Field-Aware Factorization Machine (FFM) and Field-weighted Factorization Machine (FwFM) are state-of-the-art among the shallow models for CTR prediction. Recently, many deep learning-based models have also been proposed. Among deeper models, DeepFM, xDeepFM, AutoInt+, and FiBiNet are state-of-the-art models. The deeper models combine a core architectural component, which learns explicit feature interactions, with a deep neural network (DNN) component. We propose a novel shallow Field-Embedded Factorization Machine (FEFM) and its deep counterpart Deep Field-Embedded Factorization Machine (DeepFEFM). FEFM learns symmetric matrix embeddings for each ﬁeld pair along with the usual single vector embeddings for each feature. FEFM has signiﬁcantly lower model complexity than FFM and roughly the same complexity as FwFM. FEFM also has insightful mathematical properties about important ﬁelds and ﬁeld interactions. DeepFEFM combines the FEFM interaction vectors learned by the FEFM component with a DNN and is thus able to learn higher order interactions. We conducted comprehensive experiments over a wide range of hyperparameters on two large publicly available real-world datasets. When comparing test AUC and log loss, the results show that FEFM and DeepFEFM outperform the existing state-of-the-art shallow and deep models for CTR prediction tasks. We have made the code of FEFM and DeepFEFM available in the DeepCTR library(https: //github.com/shenweichen/DeepCTR).},

Models based on degree-2 polynomial mappings and factorization machines (FMs) are widely used for this task. Recently, a variant of FMs, ﬁeldaware factorization machines (FFMs), outperforms existing models in some world-wide CTR-prediction competitions. Based on our experiences in winning two of them, in this paper we establish FFMs as an eﬀective method for classifying large sparse data including those from CTR prediction. First, we propose eﬃcient implementations for training FFMs. Then we comprehensively analyze FFMs and compare this approach with competing models. Experiments show that FFMs are very useful for certain classiﬁcation problems. Finally, we have released a package of FFMs for public use.},

The data involved in CTR prediction are typically multi-field categorical data, i.e., every feature is categorical and belongs to one and only one field. One of the interesting characteristics of such data is that features from one field often interact differently with features from different other fields. Recently, Fieldaware Factorization Machines (FFMs) have been among the best performing models for CTR prediction by explicitly modeling such difference. However, the number of parameters in FFMs is in the order of feature number times field number, which is unacceptable in the real-world production systems. In this paper, we propose Field-weighted Factorization Machines (FwFMs) to model the different feature interactions between different fields in a much more memory-efficient way. Our experimental evaluations show that FwFMs can achieve competitive prediction performance with only as few as 4\% parameters of FFMs. When using the same number of parameters, FwFMs can bring 0.92\% and 0.47\% AUC lift over FFMs on two real CTR prediction data sets.},

	abstract = {Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which aims to predict the probability of a user clicking on an ad or an item, is critical to many online applications such as online advertising and recommender systems. The problem is very challenging since (1) the input features (e.g., the user id, user age, item id, item category) are usually sparse and high-dimensional, and (2) an effective prediction relies on highorder combinatorial features (a.k.a. cross features), which are very time-consuming to hand-craft by domain experts and are impossible to be enumerated. Therefore, there have been efforts in finding lowdimensional representations of the sparse and high-dimensional raw features and their meaningful combinations. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient method called the AutoInt to automatically learn the high-order feature interactions of input features. Our proposed algorithm is very general, which can be applied to both numerical and categorical input features. Specifically, we map both the numerical and categorical features into the same low-dimensional space. Afterwards, a multihead self-attentive neural network with residual connections is proposed to explicitly model the feature interactions in the lowdimensional space. With different layers of the multi-head selfattentive neural networks, different orders of feature combinations of input features can be modeled. The whole model can be efficiently fit on large-scale raw data in an end-to-end fashion. Experimental results on four real-world datasets show that our proposed approach not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches for prediction but also offers good explainability.

	abstract = {Advertising and feed ranking are essential to many Internet companies such as Facebook and Sina Weibo. Among many real-world advertising and feed ranking systems, click through rate (CTR) prediction plays a central role. There are many proposed models in this field such as logistic regression, tree based models, factorization machine based models and deep learning based CTR models. However, many current works calculate the feature interactions in a simple way such as Hadamard product and inner product and they care less about the importance of features. In this paper, a new model named FiBiNET as an abbreviation for Feature Importance and Bilinear feature Interaction NETwork is proposed to dynamically learn the feature importance and fine-grained feature interactions. On the one hand, the FiBiNET can dynamically learn the importance of features via the Squeeze-Excitation network (SENET) mechanism; on the other hand, it is able to effectively learn the feature interactions via bilinear function. We conduct extensive experiments on two realworld datasets and show that our shallow model outperforms other shallow models such as factorization machine(FM) and field-aware factorization machine(FFM). In order to improve performance further, we combine a classical deep neural network(DNN) component with the shallow model to be a deep model. The deep FiBiNET consistently outperforms the other state-of-the-art deep models such as DeepFM and extreme deep factorization machine(XdeepFM).},

For better user satisfaction and business effectiveness, multitask learning is one of the most important methods in e-commerce. Some existing researches model user representation based on historical behaviour sequence to capture user interests. It is often the case that user interests may change from their past routines. However, multi-perspective attention has broad horizon, which covers different characteristics of human reasoning, emotions, perception, attention, and memory. In this paper, we attempt to introduce the multi-perspective attention and sequence behaviour into multitask learning. Our proposed method offers better understanding of user interest and decision. To achieve more flexible parameter sharing and maintaining the special feature advantage of each task, we improve the attention mechanism at the view of expert interactive. To the best of our knowledge, we firstly propose the implicit interaction mode, the explicit hard interaction mode, the explicit soft interaction mode, and the data fusion mode in multitask learning. We do experiments on public data and lab medical data. The results show that our model consistently achieves remarkable improvements to the state-of-the-art method.},

              We address the problem of user intent prediction from clickstream data of an e-commerce website via two conceptually different approaches: a hand-crafted feature-based classification and a deep learning-based classification. In both approaches, we deliberately coarse-grain a new clickstream proprietary dataset to produce symbolic trajectories with minimal information. Then, we tackle the problem of trajectory classification of arbitrary length and ultimately, early prediction of limited-length trajectories, both for balanced and unbalanced datasets. Our analysis shows that

              -gram statistics with visibility graph motifs produce fast and accurate classifications, highlighting that purchase prediction is reliable even for extremely short observation windows. In the deep learning case, we benchmarked previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the new dataset, and improved classification accuracy over SOTA performances with our proposed LSTM architecture. We conclude with an in-depth error analysis and a careful evaluation of the pros and cons of the two approaches when applied to realistic industry use cases.},

              Severe class imbalance between majority and minority classes in Big Data can bias the predictive performance of
              Machine Learning
              algorithms toward the majority (negative) class. Where the minority (positive) class holds greater value than the majority (negative) class and the occurrence of false negatives incurs a greater penalty than false positives, the bias may lead to adverse consequences. Our paper incorporates two case studies, each utilizing three learners, six sampling approaches, two performance metrics, and five sampled distribution ratios, to uniquely investigate the effect of severe class imbalance on Big Data analytics. The learners (
              Gradient-Boosted Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest
              ) were implemented within the Apache Spark framework. The first case study is based on a Medicare fraud detection dataset. The second case study, unlike the first, includes training data from one source (SlowlorisBig Dataset) and test data from a separate source (POST dataset). Results from the Medicare case study are not conclusive regarding the best sampling approach using
              Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve
              and
              Geometric Mean
              performance metrics. However, it should be noted that the
              Random Undersampling
              approach performs adequately in the first case study. For the SlowlorisBig case study, Random Undersampling convincingly outperforms the other five sampling approaches (
              Random Oversampling, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique, SMOTE-borderline1 , SMOTE-borderline2 , ADAptive SYNthetic

              and
              Geometric Mean
              metrics. Based on its classification performance in both case studies,
              Random Undersampling
              is the best choice as it results in models with a significantly smaller number of samples, thus reducing computational burden and training time.},

Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of “normal” examples with only a small percentage of “abnormal” or “interesting” examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classiﬁer to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classiﬁer performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classiﬁer performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classiﬁer. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.},

	abstract = {Type inference is the task of identifying the type of values in a data column and has been studied extensively in the literature. Most existing type inference methods support data types such as Boolean, date, float, integer and string. However, these methods do not consider non-Boolean categorical variables, where there are more than two possible values encoded by integers or strings. Therefore, such columns are annotated either as integer or string rather than categorical, and need to be transformed into categorical manually by the user. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic type inference method that can identify the general categorical data type (including non-Boolean variables). Additionally, we identify the possible values of each categorical variable by adapting the existing type inference method ptype. Combining these methods, we present ptype-cat which achieves better results than existing applicable solutions.},

A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information.
            
              Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on

              -ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced.

	abstract = {Modeling powerful interactions is a critical challenge in Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which is one of the most typical machine learning tasks in personalized advertising and recommender systems. Although developing hand-crafted interactions is effective for a small number of datasets, it generally requires laborious and tedious architecture engineering for extensive scenarios. In recent years, several neural architecture search (NAS) methods have been proposed for designing interactions automatically. However, existing methods only explore limited types and connections of operators for interaction generation, leading to low generalization ability. To address these problems, we propose a more general automated method for building powerful interactions named AutoPI. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: AutoPI adopts a more general search space in which the computational graph is generalized from existing network connections, and the interactive operators in the edges of the graph are extracted from representative hand-crafted works. It allows searching for various powerful feature interactions to produce higher AUC and lower Logloss in a wide variety of applications. Besides, AutoPI utilizes a gradient-based search strategy for exploration with a significantly low computational cost. Experimentally, we evaluate AutoPI on a diverse suite of benchmark datasets, demonstrating the generalizability and efficiency of AutoPI over hand-crafted architectures and state-of-the-art NAS algorithms.},

	abstract = {Graph machine learning has been extensively studied in both academic and industry. However, as the literature on graph learning booms with a vast number of emerging methods and techniques, it becomes increasingly difficult to manually design the optimal machine learning algorithm for different graph-related tasks. To tackle the challenge, automated graph machine learning, which aims at discovering the best hyper-parameter and neural architecture configuration for different graph tasks/data without manual design, is gaining an increasing number of attentions from the research community. In this paper, we extensively discuss automated graph machine approaches, covering hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS) for graph machine learning. We briefly overview existing libraries designed for either graph machine learning or automated machine learning respectively, and further in depth introduce AutoGL, our dedicated and the world's first open-source library for automated graph machine learning. Last but not least, we share our insights on future research directions for automated graph machine learning. This paper is the first systematic and comprehensive discussion of approaches, libraries as well as directions for automated graph machine learning.},

	abstract = {Various neural network-based approaches have been proposed for more robust and accurate voice activity detection (VAD). Manual design of such neural architectures is an error-prone and time-consuming process, which prompted the development of neural architecture search (NAS) that automatically design and optimize network architectures. While NAS has been successfully applied to improve performance in a variety of tasks, it has not yet been exploited in the VAD domain. In this paper, we present the first work that utilizes NAS approaches on the VAD task. To effectively search architectures for the VAD task, we propose a modified macro structure and a new search space with a much broader range of operations that includes attention operations. The results show that the network structures found by the propose NAS framework outperform previous manually designed state-of-the-art VAD models in various noise-added and real-world-recorded datasets. We also show that the architectures searched on a particular dataset achieve improved generalization performance on unseen audio datasets.

	abstract = {The release of tabular benchmarks, such as NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201, has significantly lowered the computational overhead for conducting scientific research in neural architecture search (NAS). Although they have been widely adopted and used to tune real-world NAS algorithms, these benchmarks are limited to small search spaces and focus solely on image classification. Recently, several new NAS benchmarks have been introduced that cover significantly larger search spaces over a wide range of tasks, including object detection, speech recognition, and natural language processing. However, substantial differences among these NAS benchmarks have so far prevented their widespread adoption, limiting researchers to using just a few benchmarks. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of popular NAS algorithms and performance prediction methods across 25 different combinations of search spaces and datasets, finding that many conclusions drawn from a few NAS benchmarks do not generalize to other benchmarks. To help remedy this problem, we introduce NAS-Bench-Suite, a comprehensive and extensible collection of NAS benchmarks, accessible through a unified interface, created with the aim to facilitate reproducible, generalizable, and rapid NAS research.

In this paper, we review some Machine Learning (ML) models and methods proposed in the literature to analyze their strengths and weaknesses. Then, we propose their use—alone or in combination with other approaches—to provide possible valid AutoML solutions. We analyze those solutions from a theoretical point of view and evaluate them empirically on three Atari games from the Arcade Learning Environment. Our goal is to identify what, we believe, could be some promising ways to create truly effective AutoML frameworks, therefore able to replace the human expert as much as possible, thereby making easier the process of applying ML approaches to typical problems of specific domains.

	abstract = {Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods have been growing in popularity. These techniques have been fundamental to automate and speed up the time consuming and error-prone process of synthesizing novel Deep Learning (DL) architectures. NAS has been extensively studied in the past few years. Arguably their most significant impact has been in image classification and object detection tasks where the state of the art results have been obtained. Despite the significant success achieved to date, applying NAS to real-world problems still poses significant challenges and is not widely practical. In general, the synthesized Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architectures are too complex to be deployed in resource-limited platforms, such as IoT, mobile, and embedded systems. One solution growing in popularity is to use multi-objective optimization algorithms in the NAS search strategy by taking into account execution latency, energy consumption, memory footprint, etc. This kind of NAS, called hardware-aware NAS (HW-NAS), makes searching the most efficient architecture more complicated and opens several questions. In this survey, we provide a detailed review of existing HW-NAS research and categorize them according to four key dimensions: the search space, the search strategy, the acceleration technique, and the hardware cost estimation strategies. We further discuss the challenges and limitations of existing approaches and potential future directions. This is the first survey paper focusing on hardware-aware NAS. We hope it serves as a valuable reference for the various techniques and algorithms discussed and paves the road for future research towards hardware-aware NAS.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10584},
	abstract = {HardWare-aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has recently gained tremendous attention by automating the design of DNNs deployed in more resource-constrained daily life devices. Despite its promising performance, developing optimal HW-NAS solutions can be prohibitively challenging as it requires cross-disciplinary knowledge in the algorithm, micro-architecture, and device-specific compilation. First, to determine the hardware-cost to be incorporated into the NAS process, existing works mostly adopt either pre-collected hardware-cost look-up tables or device-specific hardware-cost models. Both of them limit the development of HW-NAS innovations and impose a barrier-to-entry to non-hardware experts. Second, similar to generic NAS, it can be notoriously difficult to benchmark HW-NAS algorithms due to their significant required computational resources and the differences in adopted search spaces, hyperparameters, and hardware devices. To this end, we develop HW-NAS-Bench, the first public dataset for HW-NAS research which aims to democratize HW-NAS research to non-hardware experts and make HW-NAS research more reproducible and accessible. To design HW-NAS-Bench, we carefully collected the measured/estimated hardware performance of all the networks in the search spaces of both NAS-Bench-201 and FBNet, on six hardware devices that fall into three categories (i.e., commercial edge devices, FPGA, and ASIC). Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the collected measurements in HW-NAS-Bench to provide insights for HW-NAS research. Finally, we demonstrate exemplary user cases to (1) show that HW-NAS-Bench allows non-hardware experts to perform HW-NAS by simply querying it and (2) verify that dedicated device-specific HW-NAS can indeed lead to optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs. The codes and all collected data are available at https://github.com/RICE-EIC/HW-NAS-Bench.},

In this paper, we propose a framework to decouple network structure from operator search space, and use two BOHBs to search alternatively. Considering that activation function and initialization are also important parts of neural network, the generalization ability of the model will be affected. We introduce an activation function and an initialization method domain, and add them into the operator search space to form a generalized search space, so as to improve the generalization ability of the child model. We then trained a GCN-based predictor using feedback from the child model. This can not only improve the search efficiency, but also solve the problem of dimension curse. Next, unlike other NAS studies, we used predictors to analyze the stability of different network structures. Finally, we applied our framework to neural structure search and achieved significant improvements on multiple datasets.},

	abstract = {Neural architecture search (NAS) methods aim to automatically find the optimal deep neural network (DNN) architecture as measured by a given objective function, typically some combination of task accuracy and inference efficiency. For many areas, such as computer vision and natural language processing, this is a critical, yet still time consuming process. New NAS methods have recently made progress in improving the efficiency of this process. We implement an extensible and modular framework for Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DNAS) to help solve this problem. We include an overview of the major components of our codebase and how they interact, as well as a section on implementing extensions to it (including a sample), in order to help users adopt our framework for their applications across different categories of deep learning models. To assess the capabilities of our methodology and implementation, we apply DNAS to the problem of ads click-through rate (CTR) prediction, arguably the highest-value and most worked on AI problem at hyperscalers today. We develop and tailor novel search spaces to a Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM) backbone for CTR prediction, and report state-of-the-art results on the Criteo Kaggle CTR prediction dataset.},

In many cases it functions like an advertorial, and manifests as a video, article or editorial. The word native refers to this coherence of the content with the other media that appear on the platform.
These ads reduce a consumers' ad recognition by blending the ad into the native content of the platform, even if it is labeled as "sponsored" or "branded" content. Readers may have difficulty immediately identifying them as advertisements due to their ambiguous nature, especially when deceptive labels such as "From around the web" are used.Product placement (embedded marketing) is a precursor to native advertising. The former places the product within the content, whereas in native marketing, which is legally permissible in the US to the extent that there is sufficient disclosure, the product and content are merged.},

Search advertisements are targeted to match key search terms (called keywords) entered on search engines. This targeting ability has contributed to the attractiveness of search advertising for advertisers. Consumers will often use a search engine to identify and compare purchasing options immediately before making a purchasing decision. The opportunity to present consumers with advertisements tailored to their immediate buying interests encourages consumers to click on search ads instead of unpaid search results, which are often less relevant. For the online user, Sponsored Search Advertisement offers highly relevant search results which are based on the consumer’s own queries and, thus, they are considered less intrusive than banner advertisements or pop-ups advertising. In addition, Sponsored Search Advertisement reduces online user search costs and increases the accessibility to useful information within a limited time frame. Consequently, Sponsored Search Advertisement has become an important element of online users browsing and information searching experiences on the Web.

	abstract = {Deep learning has made breakthroughs and substantial in many fields due to its powerful automatic representation capabilities. It has been proven that neural architecture design is crucial to the feature representation of data and the final performance. However, the design of the neural architecture heavily relies on the researchers' prior knowledge and experience. And due to the limitations of human' inherent knowledge, it is difficult for people to jump out of their original thinking paradigm and design an optimal model. Therefore, an intuitive idea would be to reduce human intervention as much as possible and let the algorithm automatically design the neural architecture. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is just such a revolutionary algorithm, and the related research work is complicated and rich. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic survey on the NAS is essential. Previously related surveys have begun to classify existing work mainly based on the key components of NAS: search space, search strategy, and evaluation strategy. While this classification method is more intuitive, it is difficult for readers to grasp the challenges and the landmark work involved. Therefore, in this survey, we provide a new perspective: beginning with an overview of the characteristics of the earliest NAS algorithms, summarizing the problems in these early NAS algorithms, and then providing solutions for subsequent related research work. Besides, we conduct a detailed and comprehensive analysis, comparison, and summary of these works. Finally, we provide some possible future research directions.},

To attain good performances, the neural network architecture used for a given application must be chosen with care.

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a framework introduced to mitigate such risks by jointly optimizing the network architectures and its weights. Albeit its novelty, it was applied on complex tasks with signiﬁcant results – e.g. semantic image segmentation. In this technical paper, we aim to evaluate its ability to tackle a challenging operational task: semantic segmentation of objects of interest in satellite imagery. Designing a NAS framework is not trivial and has strong dependencies to hardware constraints. We therefore motivate our NAS approach selection and provide corresponding implementation details. We also present novel ideas to carry out other such use-case studies.},

	abstract = {In the time of Big Data, training complex models on large-scale data sets is challenging, making it appealing to reduce data volume for saving computation resources by subsampling. Most previous works in subsampling are weighted methods designed to help the performance of subset-model approach the full-set-model, hence the weighted methods have no chance to acquire a subset-model that is better than the full-set-model. However, we question that how can we achieve better model with less data? In this work, we propose a novel Unweighted Influence Data Subsampling (UIDS) method, and prove that the subset-model acquired through our method can outperform the full-set-model. Besides, we show that overly confident on a given test set for sampling is common in Influence-based subsampling methods, which can eventually cause our subset-model's failure in out-of-sample test. To mitigate it, we develop a probabilistic sampling scheme to control the worst-case risk over all distributions close to the empirical distribution. The experiment results demonstrate our methods superiority over existed subsampling methods in diverse tasks, such as text classification, image classification, click-through prediction, etc.},

              The size of today’s biomedical data sets pushes computer equipment to its limits, even for seemingly standard analysis tasks such as data projection or clustering. Reducing large biomedical data by downsampling is therefore a common early step in data processing, often performed as random uniform class-proportional downsampling. In this report, we hypothesized that this can be optimized to obtain samples that better reflect the entire data set than those obtained using the current standard method.
            
            
              Results
              By repeating the random sampling and comparing the distribution of the drawn sample with the distribution of the original data, it was possible to establish a method for obtaining subsets of data that better reflect the entire data set than taking only the first randomly selected subsample, as is the current standard. Experiments on artificial and real biomedical data sets showed that the reconstruction of the remaining data from the original data set from the downsampled data improved significantly. This was observed with both principal component analysis and autoencoding neural networks. The fidelity was dependent on both the number of cases drawn from the original and the number of samples drawn.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Optimal distribution-preserving class-proportional downsampling yields data subsets that reflect the structure of the entire data better than those obtained with the standard method. By using distributional similarity as the only selection criterion, the proposed method does not in any way affect the results of a later planned analysis.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in communication enable individuals to use phones and computers to access information on the web. E-commerce has seen rapid development, e.g., Alibaba has nearly 12 hundred million customers in China. Click-Through Rate (CTR) forecasting is a primary task in the e-commerce advertisement system. From the traditional Logistic Regression algorithm to the latest popular deep neural network methods that follow a similar embedding and MLP, several algorithms are used to predict CTR. This research proposes a hybrid model combining the Deep Interest Network (DIN) and eXtreme Deep Factorization Machine (xDeepFM) to perform CTR prediction robustly. The cores of DIN and xDeepFM are attention and feature cross, respectively. DIN follows an adaptive local activation unit that incorporates the attention mechanism to adaptively learn user interest from historical behaviors related to specific advertisements. xDeepFM further includes a critical part, a Compressed Interactions Network (CIN), aiming to generate feature interactions at a vectorwise level implicitly. Furthermore, a CIN, plain DNN, and a linear part are combined into one unified model to form xDeepFM. The proposed end-to-end hybrid model is a parallel ensemble of models via multilayer perceptron. CIN and xDeepFM are trained in parallel, and their output is fed into a multilayer perceptron. We used the e-commerce Alibaba dataset with the focal loss as the loss function for experimental evaluation through online complex example mining (OHEM) in the training process. The experimental result indicates that the proposed hybrid model has better performance than other models.},

	abstract = {Due to the development of internet technology and computer science, data is exploding at an exponential rate. Big data brings us new opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, we can analyze and mine big data to discover hidden information and get more potential value. On the other hand, the 5V characteristic of big data, especially Volume which means large amount of data, brings challenges to storage and processing. For some traditional data mining algorithms, machine learning algorithms and data profiling tasks, it is very difficult to handle such a large amount of data. The large amount of data is highly demanding hardware resources and time consuming. Sampling methods can effectively reduce the amount of data and help speed up data processing. Hence, sampling technology has been widely studied and used in big data context, e.g., methods for determining sample size, combining sampling with big data processing frameworks. Data profiling is the activity that finds metadata of data set and has many use cases, e.g., performing data profiling tasks on relational data, graph data, and time series data for anomaly detection and data repair. However, data profiling is computationally expensive, especially for large data sets. Therefore, this paper focuses on researching sampling and profiling in big data context and investigates the application of sampling in different categories of data profiling tasks. From the experimental results of these studies, the results got from the sampled data are close to or even exceed the results of the full amount of data. Therefore, sampling technology plays an important role in the era of big data, and we also have reason to believe that sampling technology will become an indispensable step in big data processing in the future.},

In cluster computing, data partitioning and sampling are two fundamental strategies to speed up the computation of big data and increase scalability. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the methods and techniques of data partitioning and sampling with respect to big data processing and analysis. We start with an overview of the mainstream big data frameworks on Hadoop clusters. The basic methods of data partitioning are then discussed including three classical horizontal partitioning schemes: range, hash, and random partitioning. Data partitioning on Hadoop clusters is also discussed with a summary of new strategies for big data partitioning, including the new Random Sample Partition (RSP) distributed model. The classical methods of data sampling are then investigated, including simple random sampling, stratiﬁed sampling, and reservoir sampling. Two common methods of big data sampling on computing clusters are also discussed: record-level sampling and blocklevel sampling. Record-level sampling is not as efﬁcient as block-level sampling on big distributed data. On the other hand, block-level sampling on data blocks generated with the classical data partitioning methods does not necessarily produce good representative samples for approximate computing of big data. In this survey, we also summarize the prevailing strategies and related work on sampling-based approximation on Hadoop clusters. We believe that data partitioning and sampling should be considered together to build approximate cluster computing frameworks that are reliable in both the computational and statistical respects.},

	abstract = {The imbalanced classiﬁcation problem turns out to be one of the important and challenging problems in data mining and machine learning. The performances of traditional classiﬁers will be severely aﬀected by many data problems, such as class imbalanced problem, class overlap and noise. When the number of one class in the data set is larger than other classes, class imbalanced problem will inevitably occur. Therefore, many researchers are committed to solving the problem of category imbalance and improving the overall classiﬁcation performances of the classiﬁer. The Tomek-Link algorithm was only used to clean data when it was proposed. In recent years, there have been reports of combining Tomek-Link algorithm with sampling technique. The Tomek-Link sampling algorithm can eﬀectively reduce the class overlap on data, remove the majority instances that are diﬃcult to distinguish, and improve the algorithm classiﬁcation accuracy. However, the Tomek-Links under-sampling algorithm only considers the boundary instances that are the nearest neighbors to each other globally and ignores the potential local overlapping instances. When the number of minority instances is small, the undersampling eﬀect is not satisfactory, and the performance improvement of the classiﬁcation model is not obvious. Therefore, on the basis of Tomek-Link, a multi-granularity relabeled under-sampling algorithm (MGRU) is proposed. This algorithm fully considers the local information of the data set in the local granularity subspace, and detects the local potential overlapping instances in the data set. Then, the overlapped majority instances are eliminated according to the global relabeled index value, which eﬀectively expands the detection range of Tomek-Links. The simulation results show that when we select the optimal global relabeled index value for under-sampling, the classiﬁcation accuracy and generalization performance of the proposed under-sampling algorithm are signiﬁcantly better than other baseline algorithms.},

However, in most real-life scenarios, the true demand distributions are not available or they are too complex to work with. Thus, a sampling-driven algorithmic framework is very attractive, both in practice and in theory. We shall describe how to compute sampling-based policies, that is, policies that are computed based only on observed samples of the demands without any access to, or assumptions on, the true demand distributions. Moreover, we establish bounds on the number of samples required to guarantee that with high probability, the expected cost of the sampling-based policies is arbitrarily close (i.e., with arbitrarily small relative error) compared to the expected cost of the optimal policies which have full access to the demand distributions. The bounds that we develop are general, easy to compute and do not depend at all on the specifc demand distributions.},

These goals were achieved by eliminating redundant and noisy samples, thus reducing the size of the training set. In this paper, the performance of instance selection methods is investigated in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy and reduction of training set size. The classiﬁcation accuracy of the following classiﬁers is evaluated: decision trees, random forest, Naive Bayes, linear model, support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors. The obtained results indicate that for the most of the classiﬁers compressing the training set affects prediction performance and only a small group of instance selection methods can be recommended as a general purpose preprocessing step. These are learning vector quantization based algorithms, along with the Drop2 and Drop3. Other methods are less efﬁcient or provide low compression ratio.},

It does not matter how powerful the computers are or will be in future, data mining algorithms must consider how to manage this ever-growing data that can be too large (for example terabytes of data) to be processed. Therefore we consider instance reduction as an important task in the data preparation phase of knowledge discovery and data mining. Major approaches for instance reduction are supervised instance filters (resample, spread subsample, stratified remove folds) and unsupervised instance filters (remove with values, reservoir sample, remove percentage). This paper provides a comparative study on existing techniques for instance reduction.},

	abstract = {Training machine learning models requires feeding input data for models to ingest. Input pipelines for machine learning jobs are often challenging to implement efficiently as they require reading large volumes of data, applying complex transformations, and transferring data to hardware accelerators while overlapping computation and communication to achieve optimal performance. We present tf.data, a framework for building and executing efficient input pipelines for machine learning jobs. The tf.data API provides operators which can be parameterized with user-defined computation, composed, and reused across different machine learning domains. These abstractions allow users to focus on the application logic of data processing, while tf.data’s runtime ensures that pipelines run efficiently. We demonstrate that input pipeline performance is critical to the end-to-end training time of state-of-the-art machine learning models. tf.data delivers the high performance required, while avoiding the need for manual tuning of performance knobs. We show that tf.data features, such as parallelism, caching, static optimizations, and non-deterministic execution are essential for high performance. Finally, we characterize machine learning input pipelines for millions of jobs that ran in Google’s fleet, showing that input data processing is highly diverse and consumes a significant fraction of job resources. Our analysis motivates future research directions, such as sharing computation across jobs and pushing data projection to the storage layer.},

However, there is confusion about what exactly data science is, and this confusion could lead to disillusionment as the concept diffuses into meaningless buzz. In this article, we argue that there are good reasons why it has been hard to pin down exactly what is data science. One reason is that data science is intricately intertwined with other important concepts also of growing importance, such as big data and data-driven decision making. Another reason is the natural tendency to associate what a practitioner does with the deﬁnition of the practitioner’s ﬁeld; this can result in overlooking the fundamentals of the ﬁeld. We believe that trying to deﬁne the boundaries of data science precisely is not of the utmost importance. We can debate the boundaries of the ﬁeld in an academic setting, but in order for data science to serve business effectively, it is important (i) to understand its relationships to other important related concepts, and (ii) to begin to identify the fundamental principles underlying data science. Once we embrace (ii), we can much better understand and explain exactly what data science has to offer. Furthermore, only once we embrace (ii) should we be comfortable calling it data science. In this article, we present a perspective that addresses all these concepts. We close by offering, as examples, a partial list of fundamental principles underlying data science.},

	abstract = {The success of Big Data relies fundamentally on the ability of a person (the data scientist) to make sense and generate insights from this wealth of data. The process of generating actionable insights, called data exploration, is a difficult and time-consuming task. Data exploration of a big dataset usually requires first generating a small and representative data sample that can be easily plotted and viewed, managed and interpreted to generate insights. However, the literature on the topic hints at data scientists only using random sampling with regular sized datasets and it is unclear what they do with Big Data. In this work, we first show evidence from a survey that random sampling is the only technique commonly used by data scientists to quickly gain insights from a big dataset despite theoretical and empirical evidence from the active learning community that suggests benefits of using other sampling techniques. Second, to evaluate and demonstrate the benefits of other sampling techniques, we conducted an online study with 34 data scientists. These scientists performed a data exploration task to support a classification goal using data samples from more than 2 million records of editing data from Wikipedia articles, generated using different sampling techniques. The study results demonstrate that sampling techniques other than random sampling can generate insights that help to focus on different characteristics of the data, without compromising quality in a data exploration.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have achieved human-scale speed and accuracy for classification tasks. In turn, these capabilities have made AI a viable replacement for many human activities that at their core involve classification, such as basic mechanical and analytical tasks in low-level service jobs. Current systems do not need to be conscious to recognize patterns and classify them. However, for AI to progress to more complicated tasks requiring intuition and empathy, it must develop capabilities such as metathinking, creativity, and empathy akin to human self-awareness or consciousness. We contend that such a paradigm shift is possible only through a fundamental shift in the state of artificial intelligence toward consciousness, a shift similar to what took place for humans through the process of natural selection and evolution. As such, this paper aims to theoretically explore the requirements for the emergence of consciousness in AI. It also provides a principled understanding of how conscious AI can be detected and how it might be manifested in contrast to the dominant paradigm that seeks to ultimately create machines that are linguistically indistinguishable from humans.},

In contrast, our focus here is on the rarely discussed complementary aspect of engineering conscious AI: how to avoid condemning such systems, for whose creation we would be solely responsible, to unavoidable suffering brought about by phenomenal self-consciousness. We outline two complementary approaches to this problem, one motivated by a philosophical analysis of the phenomenal self, and the other by certain computational concepts in reinforcement learning.},

We distinguish between the traditional computing (GOFAI), and the computing based on stochastic pattern optimization. The latter will be called here computing at the edge of chaos. Optimization of learning patterns, which is the gist of its success, often happens between the areas of too much repetitive order and those of hard to predict and control stochastic processes. This is to change the focus from the opposition of symbolic versus sub-symbolic computing; symbols can appear at different granularities and the hedge between The Physical Symbol System Hypothesis and neural nets seems no longer the most productive cut to make. Computing at the edge of chaos is promising for AGI, especially for AGI consciousness. The second problem for AI consciousness is to work with the right definitions of consciousness.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the general problem of reinforcement learning (RL) in partially observable environments. In 2013, our large RL recurrent neural networks (RNNs) learned from scratch to drive simulated cars from high-dimensional video input. However, real brains are more powerful in many ways. In particular, they learn a predictive model of their initially unknown environment, and somehow use it for abstract (e.g., hierarchical) planning and reasoning. Guided by algorithmic information theory, we describe RNN-based AIs (RNNAIs) designed to do the same. Such an RNNAI can be trained on never-ending sequences of tasks, some of them provided by the user, others invented by the RNNAI itself in a curious, playful fashion, to improve its RNN-based world model. Unlike our previous model-building RNN-based RL machines dating back to 1990, the RNNAI learns to actively query its model for abstract reasoning and planning and decision making, essentially "learning to think." The basic ideas of this report can be applied to many other cases where one RNN-like system exploits the algorithmic information content of another. They are taken from a grant proposal submitted in Fall 2014, and also explain concepts such as "mirror neurons." Experimental results will be described in separate papers.},

In this survey, we investigate the main scope and contributions of AI in combating COVID-19 from the aspects of disease detection and diagnosis, virology and pathogenesis, drug and vaccine development, and epidemic and transmission prediction. In addition, we summarize the available data and resources that can be used for AI-based COVID-19 research. Finally, the main challenges and potential directions of AI in fighting against COVID-19 are discussed. Currently, AI mainly focuses on medical image inspection, genomics, drug development, and transmission prediction, and thus AI still has great potential in this field. This survey presents medical and AI researchers with a comprehensive view of the existing and potential applications of AI technology in combating COVID-19 with the goal of inspiring researchers to continue to maximize the advantages of AI and big data to fight COVID-19.},

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

Only original research articles concerning algorithms applied to the LIDC-IDRI database were included. The initial search yielded 1972 publications after removing duplicates, and 41 of these articles were included in this study. The articles were divided into two subcategories describing their overall architecture. The majority of feature-based algorithms achieved an accuracy {\textgreater}90\% compared to the deep learning (DL) algorithms that achieved an accuracy in the range of 82.2\%–97.6\%. In conclusion, ML and DL algorithms are able to detect lung nodules with a high level of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity using ML, when applied to an annotated archive of CT scans of the lung. However, there is no consensus on the method applied to determine the efficiency of ML algorithms.},

	abstract = {Lung cancer is one of the major causes of cancer-related deaths due to its aggressive nature and delayed detections at advanced stages. Early detection of lung cancer is very important for the survival of an individual, and is a significant challenging problem. Generally, chest radiographs (X-ray) and computed tomography (CT) scans are used initially for the diagnosis of the malignant nodules; however, the possible existence of benign nodules leads to erroneous decisions. At early stages, the benign and the malignant nodules show very close resemblance to each other. In this paper, a novel deep learning-based model with multiple strategies is proposed for the precise diagnosis of the malignant nodules. Due to the recent achievements of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) in image analysis, we have used two deep three-dimensional (3D) customized mixed link network (CMixNet) architectures for lung nodule detection and classification, respectively. Nodule detections were performed through faster R-CNN on efficiently-learned features from CMixNet and U-Net like encoder–decoder architecture. Classification of the nodules was performed through a gradient boosting machine (GBM) on the learned features from the designed 3D CMixNet structure. To reduce false positives and misdiagnosis results due to different types of errors, the final decision was performed in connection with physiological symptoms and clinical biomarkers. With the advent of the internet of things (IoT) and electro-medical technology, wireless body area networks (WBANs) provide continuous monitoring of patients, which helps in diagnosis of chronic diseases—especially metastatic cancers. The deep learning model for nodules’ detection and classification, combined with clinical factors, helps in the reduction of misdiagnosis and false positive (FP) results in early-stage lung cancer diagnosis. The proposed system was evaluated on LIDC-IDRI datasets in the form of sensitivity (94\%) and specificity (91\%), and better results were obatined compared to the existing methods.},

              Background
              Accurate segmentation and recognition algorithm of lung nodules has great important value of reference for early diagnosis of lung cancer. An algorithm is proposed for 3D CT sequence images in this paper based on 3D Res U-Net segmentation network and 3D ResNet50 classification network. The common convolutional layers in encoding and decoding paths of U-Net are replaced by residual units while the loss function is changed to Dice loss after using cross entropy loss to accelerate network convergence. Since the lung nodules are small and rich in 3D information, the ResNet50 is improved by replacing the 2D convolutional layers with 3D convolutional layers and reducing the sizes of some convolution kernels, 3D ResNet50 network is obtained for the diagnosis of benign and malignant lung nodules.
            
            
              Results
              3D Res U-Net was trained and tested on 1044 CT subcases in the LIDC-IDRI database. The segmentation result shows that the Dice coefficient of 3D Res U-Net is above 0.8 for the segmentation of lung nodules larger than 10 mm in diameter. 3D ResNet50 was trained and tested on 2960 lung nodules in the LIDC-IDRI database. The classification result shows that the diagnostic accuracy of 3D ResNet50 is 87.3\% and AUC is 0.907.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The 3D Res U-Net module improves segmentation performance significantly with the comparison of 3D U-Net model based on residual learning mechanism. 3D Res U-Net can identify small nodules more effectively and improve its segmentation accuracy for large nodules. Compared with the original network, the classification performance of 3D ResNet50 is significantly improved, especially for small benign nodules.},

Many medical-image-processing techniques have been developed to diagnoses lung cancer at early or later stages through CT images; however, it is still a big challenge to improve the accuracy and sensitivity of the algorithms. In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on image fusion for lung segmentation to optimize lung cancer diagnosis. The image fusion technique was developed through Laplacian Pyramid (LP) decomposition along with Adaptive Sparse Representation (ASR). The suggested fusion technique fragments medical images into different sizes using the LP. After that, the LP is used to fuse the four decomposed layers. For the evaluation purposes of the proposed technique, the Lungs Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) was used. The results showed that the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) index of our proposed method was 0.9929, which is better than recently published results. Furthermore, the values of other evaluation parameters such as the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 89\%, 98\% and 99\%, respectively, which are also competitive with the recently published results.},

	abstract = {Lung CT image segmentation is a key process in many applications such as lung cancer detection. It is considered a challenging problem due to existing similar image densities in the pulmonary structures, different types of scanners, and scanning protocols. Most of the current semi-automatic segmentation methods rely on human factors therefore it might suffer from lack of accuracy. Another shortcoming of these methods is their high false-positive rate. In recent years, several approaches, based on a deep learning framework, have been effectively applied in medical image segmentation. Among existing deep neural networks, the U-Net has provided great success in this field. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network architecture to perform an automatic lung CT image segmentation process. In the proposed method, several extensive preprocessing techniques are applied to raw CT images. Then, ground truths corresponding to these images are extracted via some morphological operations and manual reforms. Finally, all the prepared images with the corresponding ground truth are fed into a modified U-Net in which the encoder is replaced with a pre-trained ResNet-34 network (referred to as Res BCDU-Net). In the architecture, we employ BConvLSTM (Bidirectional Convolutional Long Short-term Memory)as an advanced integrator module instead of simple traditional concatenators. This is to merge the extracted feature maps of the corresponding contracting path into the previous expansion of the up-convolutional layer. Finally, a densely connected convolutional layer is utilized for the contracting path. The results of our extensive experiments on lung CT images (LIDC-IDRI database) confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method where a dice coefficient index of 97.31\% is achieved.},

This paper proposes an Uncertainty-Guided Segmentation Network (UGS-Net), which learns the rich visual features from the regions that may cause segmentation uncertainty and contributes to a better segmentation result. With an Uncertainty-Aware Module, this network can provide a Multi-Confidence Mask (MCM), pointing out regions with different segmentation uncertainty levels. Moreover, this paper introduces a Feature-Aware Attention Module to enhance the learning of the nodule boundary and density differences. Experimental results show that our method can predict the nodule regions with different uncertainty levels and achieve superior performance in LIDC-IDRI dataset.},

Currently, there are many studies about the first step, but few about the second step. Since the existence of nodule does not definitely indicate cancer, and the morphology of nodule has a complicated relationship with cancer, the diagnosis of lung cancer demands careful investigations on every suspicious nodule and integration of information of all nodules. We propose a 3D deep neural network to solve this problem. The model consists of two modules. The first one is a 3D region proposal network for nodule detection, which outputs all suspicious nodules for a subject. The second one selects the top five nodules based on the detection confidence, evaluates their cancer probabilities and combines them with a leaky noisy-or gate to obtain the probability of lung cancer for the subject. The two modules share the same backbone network, a modified U-net. The over-fitting caused by the shortage of training data is alleviated by training the two modules alternately. The proposed model won the first place in the Data Science Bowl 2017 competition. The code has been made publicly available.},

This manuscript proposes a new computer-aided diagnosis system for lung cancer diagnosis from chest computed tomography scans. The proposed system extracts two different kinds of features, namely, appearance features and shape features. For the appearance features, a Histogram of oriented gradients, a Multi-view analytical Local Binary Pattern, and a Markov Gibbs Random Field are developed to give a good description of the lung nodule texture, which is one of the main distinguishing characteristics between benign and malignant nodules. For the shape features, Multi-view Peripheral Sum Curvature Scale Space, Spherical Harmonics Expansion, and a group of some fundamental morphological features are implemented to describe the outer contour complexity of the nodules, which is main factor in lung nodule diagnosis. Each feature is fed into a stacked auto-encoder followed by a soft-max classifier to generate the initial malignancy probability. Finally, all these probabilities are combined together and fed to the last network to give the final diagnosis. The system is validated using 727 nodules which are subset from the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) dataset. The system shows very high performance measures and achieves 92.55\%, 91.70\%, and 93.40\% for the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively. This high performance shows the ability of the system to distinguish between the malignant and benign nodules precisely.},

Accurate lung nodule detection and segmentation in computed tomography (CT) images is a vital step for diagnosing lung cancer early. Most existing systems face several challenges, such as the heterogeneity in CT images and variation in nodule size, shape, and location, which limit their accuracy. In an attempt to handle these challenges, this article proposes a fully automated deep learning framework that consists of lung nodule detection and segmentation models. Our proposed system comprises two cascaded stages: (1) nodule detection based on fine-tuned Faster R-CNN to localize the nodules in CT images, and (2) nodule segmentation based on the U-Net architecture with two effective blocks, namely position attention-aware weight excitation (PAWE) and channel attention-aware weight excitation (CAWE), to enhance the ability to discriminate between nodule and non-nodule feature representations. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system yields a Dice score of 89.79\% and 90.35\%, and an intersection over union (IoU) of 82.34\% and 83.21\% on the publicly available LUNA16 and LIDC-IDRI datasets, respectively.},

            We present a hybrid algorithm to estimate lung nodule malignancy that combines imaging biomarkers from Radiologist’s annotation with image classification of CT scans. Our algorithm employs a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as well as a Random Forest in order to combine CT imagery with biomarker annotation and volumetric radiomic features. We analyze and compare the performance of the algorithm using only imagery, only biomarkers, combined imagery + biomarkers, combined imagery + volumetric radiomic features, and finally the combination of imagery + biomarkers + volumetric features in order to classify the suspicion level of nodule malignancy. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) IDRI dataset is used to train and evaluate the classification task. We show that the incorporation of semi-supervised learning by means of K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) can increase the available training sample size of the LIDC-IDRI, thereby further improving the accuracy of malignancy estimation of most of the models tested although there is no significant improvement with the use of KNN semi-supervised learning if image classification with CNNs and volumetric features is combined with descriptive biomarkers. Unexpectedly, we also show that a model using image biomarkers alone is more accurate than one that combines biomarkers with volumetric radiomics, 3D CNNs, and semi-supervised learning. We discuss the possibility that this result may be influenced by cognitive bias in LIDC-IDRI because malignancy estimates were recorded by the same radiologist panel as biomarkers, as well as future work to incorporate pathology information over a subset of study participants.},

	abstract = {Numerous automatic systems of pulmonary nodules detection have been proposed, but very few of them have been consecrated to micro-nodules (diameter {\textless} 3 mm) even though they are regarded as the earliest manifestations of lung cancer. Moreover, most available systems present high false positive rate resulting from their incapability of discriminating between micro-nodules and non-nodules. Thus, this paper proposes a system to differentiate between the micro-nodules and non-nodules in computed tomography (CT) images by an ensemble learning of multiple-view 3-D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs). A total of 34 494 volumetric image samples, including 13 179 micro-nodules and 21 315 non-nodules, are acquired from the 1010 CT scans of the LIDC/IDRI database. The pulmonary nodule candidates are cropped with ﬁve different sizes, including 20 × 20 × 3, 16 × 16 × 3, 12 × 12 × 3, 8 × 8 × 3, and 4 × 4 × 3. Then, ﬁve distinct 3D-CNN models are built and implemented on one size of the nodule candidates. An extreme learning machine (ELM) network is utilized to integrate the ﬁve 3D-CNN outputs, yielding the ﬁnal classiﬁcation results. The performance of the proposed system is assessed in terms of accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), F-score, and sensitivity. It is found that the proposed system yields an accuracy, AUC, F-score, and sensitivity of 97.35\%, 0.98, 96.42\%, and 96.57\%, respectively. These performances are highly superior to those of 2D-CNNs, single 3D-CNN model, as well as those by the state-of-the-art methods implemented on the same dataset. For the ensemble method, ELM achieves better performance than the majority voting, averaging, AND operator, and autoencoder. The results demonstrate that developing an automatic system for discriminating between micro-nodules and non-nodules in CT images is feasible, which extends lung cancer studies to micro-nodules. The combination of multiple-view 3D-CNNs and ensemble learning contribute to excellent identiﬁcation performance, and this strategy may help develop other reliable clinical-decision support systems.},

Two optimization techniques (GA and NSGA-II) are applied on these features to overcome the imbalanced and nonsorted data problem. The CNN is used with SVM (no optimization) showed the accuracy of 80\% and 82\% for radiomic and radiomic+deep features.

By treating the multiple nodules from a same patient as a whole, critical relational information between solitary-nodule voxels is extracted. To our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst study to learn the relations between multiple pulmonary nodules. Inspired by recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) domain, we introduce a self-attention transformer equipped with 3D CNN, named NoduleSAT, to replace typical pooling-based aggregation in multiple instance learning.

	abstract = {Various deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to distinguish between benign and malignant pulmonary nodules using CT images. However, single learner usually presents unsatisﬁed performance due to limited hypothesis space, or falling into local minima, or wrong selection of hypothesis space. To tackle these issues, we propose to build ensemble learners through fusing multiple deep CNN learners for pulmonary nodules classiﬁcation. CT image patches of 743 nodules are extracted from LIDC-IDRI database and utilized. First, eight deep CNN learners with different architectures are trained and evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation. Each nodule has eight predictions from the eight primary learners. Second, we fuse these eight predictions by the strategies of majority voting (VOT), averaging (AVE), or machine learning. Speciﬁcally, different machine learning algorithms including K-NearestNeighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Trees (DT), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forests (RF), Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) are implemented. Moreover, the correlation coefﬁcients between the predictions of 10 ensemble learners are calculated, and the hierarchical clustering dendrogram is drawn. It is found that the ensemble learners achieve higher prediction accuracy (84.0\% vs 81.7\%) than single CNN learner. The overlap ratio among the 10 ensemble learners is much higher than that of the 8 primary learners (62.9\% vs 33.2\%). In addition, it is shown that ensemble learners are roughly divided into three categories: the ﬁrst (SVM, MLP, GBRT and RF) achieves the best performance; the second (VOT and AVE) is better than the third (AdaBoost, DT, NB and KNN). VOT and AVE yield higher recall than the machine learning algorithms. These results indicate that ensemble learners based on multiple CNN learners can achieve better performances for pulmonary nodules classiﬁcation using CT images and that preferred fusion strategies include SVM, MLP, GBRT and RF.},

Therefore, classiﬁcation of lesion at early stage is a powerful tool to increase the chance of survival of a patient. In this paper a novel system for lesion classiﬁcation as either nodule or non-nodule followed by malignancy classiﬁcation (benign or malignant) is presented. Three dimensional (3D) lung tissue is constructed from the two dimensional (2D) slices of the patient CT scan. Lung is segmented by a thresholding based method, and lesions are extracted with triplanar views, axial, coronal, and sagittal. For classiﬁcation, two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are cascaded, where the ﬁrst network for lesion classiﬁcation and the second for malignancy classiﬁcation with concatenated triplaner views as an input in both stages. Experimental results performed on 1010 patients from Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) reveal that, the proposed approach achieved the best performance in lesion and malignancy classiﬁcation with an accuracy of 82.58\% and 82.62\% respectively compared with existing methods.},

The former is for nodule candidate detection and the latter is for false positive (FP) reduction. A hard mining scheme for retraining is devised to improve the FP reduction performance.

Compared with 2D nodule CT images, the 3D volumes with entire nodule objects hold richer discriminative information. However, for deep learning methods driven by massive data, effectively capturing the 3D discriminative features of nodules in limited labeled samples is a challenging task. Different from previous models that proposed transfer learning models in a 2D pattern or learning from scratch 3D models, we develop a self-supervised transfer learning based on domain adaptation (SSTL-DA) 3D CNN framework for benign-malignant lung nodule classiﬁcation. At ﬁrst, a data pre-processing strategy termed adaptive slice selection (ASS) is developed to eliminate the redundant noise of the input samples with lung nodules. Then, the self-supervised learning network is constructed to learn robust image representations from CT images. Finally, a transfer learning method based on domain adaptation is designed to obtain discriminant features for classiﬁcation. The proposed SSTL-DA method has been assessed on the LIDC-IDRI benchmark dataset, and it obtains an accuracy of 91.07\% and an AUC of 95.84\%. These results demonstrate that the SSTL-DA model achieves quite a competitive classiﬁcation performance compared with some state-of-the-art approaches.},

However, effectively capturing the nodule’s structural information from CT scans in a computer-aided system is a challenging task. Unlike previous models that proposed computationally intensive deep ensemble models or three-dimensional CNN models, we propose a lightweight, multiple view sampling based multi-section CNN architecture. The model obtains a nodule’s cross sections from multiple view angles and encodes the nodule’s volumetric information into a compact representation by aggregating information from its different cross sections via a view pooling layer. The compact feature is subsequently used for the task of nodule classiﬁcation. The method does not require the nodule’s spatial annotation and works directly on the cross sections generated from volume enclosing the nodule. We evaluated the proposed method on lung image database consortium (LIDC) and image database resource initiative (IDRI) dataset. It achieved the state-of-the-art performance with a mean 93.18\% classiﬁcation accuracy. The architecture could also be used to select the representative cross sections determining the nodule’s malignancy that facilitates in the interpretation of results. Because of being lightweight, the model could be ported to mobile devices, which brings the power of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) driven application directly into the practitioner’s hand.},

As per the report of World Health Organization (WHO), around 18 million people die due to lung cancer every year. Though there are many standard detecting techniques available, most of the patients die in a year of diagnosis. Hence, it is essential to find an alternative approach for the early recognition of lung cancer, which altogether improves the odds of endurance. This paper addresses the classification and recognition task to detect lung tumor in the early stages of Computerized Tomography (CT) scans for lungs. Lung  Image Database  Consortium and Infectious  Disease Research  Institute (LIDC/IDRI) lung image dataset is used for this purpose. Convolutional-Neural-Network  (CNN) based deep learning (DL) approach is proposed for the recognition and classification from the CT scan images and the results are compared with the classical machine learning algorithms in the literature with respect to standard evaluation metrics. It is additionally observed that, the Deep CNN classifier has  performed better than all the other three traditional classification algorithm in the literature  and viewed as the viable classifier.},

In this paper, we consider the problem of diagnostic classiﬁcation between benign and malignant lung nodules in CT images, which aims to learn a direct mapping from 3D images to class labels. To achieve this goal, four two-pathway Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are proposed, including a basic 3D CNN, a novel multi-output network, a 3D DenseNet, and an augmented 3D DenseNet with multi-outputs. These four networks are evaluated on the public LIDC-IDRI dataset and outperform most existing methods. In particular, the 3D multi-output DenseNet (MoDenseNet) achieves the state-of-the-art classiﬁcation accuracy on the task of end-to-end lung nodule diagnosis. In addition, the networks pretrained on the LIDC-IDRI dataset can be further extended to handle smaller datasets using transfer learning. This is demonstrated on our dataset with encouraging prediction accuracy in lung nodule classiﬁcation.},

	abstract = {Lung nodules are vital indicators for the presence of lung cancer. An early detection enhances the survival rate of the patient by starting treatment at the right time. The detection and classiﬁcation of malignancy in Computed Tomography (CT) images is a very time-consuming and difﬁcult task for radiologists which lead the researchers to develop algorithms for Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems to mitigate this burden. The performance of CAD systems is continuously improving by using various deep learning techniques for screening of lung cancer. In this paper, we proposed transferable texture Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to improve the classiﬁcation performance of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. An Energy Layer (EL) is incorporated in our scheme, which extracts texture features from the convolutional layer. The inclusion of EL reduces the number of learnable parameters of the network, which further reduces the memory requirements and computational complexity. The proposed model has only three convolutional layers and one EL, instead of pooling layer. Overall proposed CNN architecture comprises of nine layers for automatic feature extraction and classiﬁcation of pulmonary nodule candidates as malignant or benign. Furthermore, the pre-trained model of proposed CNN is also used to handle the smaller dataset classiﬁcation problem by using transfer learning. This work has been evaluated on publicly available LIDC-IDRI and the LUNGx Challenge database through different evaluation matrices, such as; the accuracy, speciﬁcity, error rate and AUC. The proposed model is trained by six-fold cross-validation and achieved an accuracy score of 96.69\% ± 0.72\% with only 3.30\% ± 0.72\% error rate. Whereas, the measured AUC and recall is 99.11\%±0.45\% and 97.19\%±0.57\%, respectively. Moreover, we also tested our proposed technique on the MNIST dataset and achieved state-of-the-art results in terms of accuracy and error rate.},

	abstract = {In this research, a fast, accurate, and stable system of lung cancer detection based on novel deep learning techniques is proposed. A convolutional neural network (CNN) structure akin to that of GoogLeNet was built using a transfer learning approach. In contrast to previous studies, Median Intensity Projection (MIP) was employed to include multi-view features of three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans. The system was evaluated on the LIDC-IDRI public dataset of lung nodule images and 100-fold data augmentation was performed to ensure training efficiency. The trained system produced 81\% accuracy, 84\% sensitivity, and 78\% specificity after 300 epochs, better than other available programs. In addition, a t-based confidence interval for the population mean of the validation accuracies verified that the proposed system would produce consistent results for multiple trials. Subsequently, a controlled variable experiment was performed to elucidate the net effects of two core factors of the system - fine-tuned GoogLeNet and MIPs - on its detection accuracy. Four treatment groups were set by training and testing fine-tuned GoogLeNet and Alexnet on MIPs and common 2D CT scans, respectively. It was noteworthy that MIPs improved the network’s accuracy by 12.3\%, and GoogLeNet outperformed Alexnet by 2\%. Lastly, remote access to the GPU-based system was enabled through a web server, which allows long-distance management of the system and its future transition into a practical tool.},

	abstract = {With more and more people suffer from lung cancer, computer-aided diagnosis plays a more and more important role in lung cancer diagnosis. CNN has achieved state-of-the-art performance in image processing, and Mask RCNN outperforms most other methods on instance segmentation. However, the target is extraordinarily small, and the background is very large in images, which results in a large number of negative examples and most of them are easy negatives. They will contribute a large part of the loss value in smooth loss function. The class imbalance problem leads to inefficient training, which makes model degenerated. In this paper, we propose a method based on Mask R-CNN to segment lung nodules. Due to the non-uniformity of CT values, we use the Laplacian operator to do feature dimensionality reduction for filtering out part of the noise. In our model, the novel function Focal Loss is used to suppress well-classified examples. The model is tested on LIDC-IDRI dataset and the results showed that the average precision of lung nodules reaches 78\%. Compared with the smooth loss function in Mask R-CNN it improves by 7\%.},

Hence, we developed two multiple resolution residually connected network (MRRN) formulations called incremental-MRRN and dense-MRRN. Our networks simultaneously combine features across multiple image resolution and feature levels through residual connections to detect and segment the lung tumors. We evaluated our method on a total of 1210 non-small cell (NSCLC) lung tumors and nodules from three data sets consisting of 377 tumors from the open-source Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), 304 advanced stage NSCLC treated with anti- PD-1 checkpoint immunotherapy from internal institution MSKCC data set, and 529 lung nodules from the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC). The algorithm was trained using 377 tumors from the TCIA data set and validated on the MSKCC and tested on LIDC data sets. The segmentation accuracy compared to expert delineations was evaluated by computing the dice similarity coefﬁcient, Hausdorff distances, sensitivity, and precision metrics. Our best performing incremental-MRRN method produced the highest DSC of 0.74 ± 0.13 for TCIA, 0.75±0.12 for MSKCC, and 0.68±0.23 for the LIDC data sets. There was no signiﬁcant difference in the estimations of volumetric tumor changes computed using the incrementalMRRN method compared with the expert segmentation. In summary, we have developed a multi-scale CNN approach for volumetrically segmenting lung tumors which enables accurate, automated identiﬁcation of and serial measurement of tumor volumes in the lung.},

	abstract = {Background
              Chest computed tomography (CT) is crucial for the detection of lung cancer, and many automated CT evaluation methods have been proposed. Due to the divergent software dependencies of the reported approaches, the developed methods are rarely compared or reproduced.
            
            
              Objective
              The goal of the research was to generate reproducible machine learning modules for lung cancer detection and compare the approaches and performances of the award-winning algorithms developed in the Kaggle Data Science Bowl.
            
            
              Methods
              We obtained the source codes of all award-winning solutions of the Kaggle Data Science Bowl Challenge, where participants developed automated CT evaluation methods to detect lung cancer (training set n=1397, public test set n=198, final test set n=506). The performance of the algorithms was evaluated by the log-loss function, and the Spearman correlation coefficient of the performance in the public and final test sets was computed.
            
            
              Results
              Most solutions implemented distinct image preprocessing, segmentation, and classification modules. Variants of U-Net, VGGNet, and residual net were commonly used in nodule segmentation, and transfer learning was used in most of the classification algorithms. Substantial performance variations in the public and final test sets were observed (Spearman correlation coefficient = .39 among the top 10 teams). To ensure the reproducibility of results, we generated a Docker container for each of the top solutions.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We compared the award-winning algorithms for lung cancer detection and generated reproducible Docker images for the top solutions. Although convolutional neural networks achieved decent accuracy, there is plenty of room for improvement regarding model generalizability.},

The nodule classiﬁcation subnetwork is validated on a public dataset from LIDC-IDRI, on which it achieves better performance than state-of-the-art approaches, and surpasses the average performance of four experienced doctors. For the DeepLung system, candidate nodules are detected ﬁrst by the nodule detection subnetwork, and nodule diagnosis is conducted by the classiﬁcation subnetwork.

	abstract = {Background: Accurately detecting and examining lung nodules early is key in diagnosing lung cancers and thus one of the best ways to prevent lung cancer deaths. Radiologists spend countless hours detecting small spherical-shaped nodules in computed tomography (CT) images. In addition, even after detecting nodule candidates, a considerable amount of effort and time is required for them to determine whether they are real nodules. The aim of this paper is to introduce a high performance nodule classification method that uses three dimensional deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and an ensemble method to distinguish nodules between non-nodules.
Methods: In this paper, we use a three dimensional deep convolutional neural network (3D DCNN) with shortcut connections and a 3D DCNN with dense connections for lung nodule classification. The shortcut connections and dense connections successfully alleviate the gradient vanishing problem by allowing the gradient to pass quickly and directly. Connections help deep structured networks to obtain general as well as distinctive features of lung nodules. Moreover, we increased the dimension of DCNNs from two to three to capture 3D features. Compared with shallow 3D CNNs used in previous studies, deep 3D CNNs more effectively capture the features of spherical-shaped nodules. In addition, we use an alternative ensemble method called the checkpoint ensemble method to boost performance.
Results: The performance of our nodule classification method is compared with that of the state-of-the-art methods which were used in the LUng Nodule Analysis 2016 Challenge. Our method achieves higher competition performance metric (CPM) scores than the state-of-the-art methods using deep learning. In the experimental setup ESB-ALL, the 3D DCNN with shortcut connections and the 3D DCNN with dense connections using the checkpoint ensemble method achieved the highest CPM score of 0.910.
Conclusion: The result demonstrates that our method of using a 3D DCNN with shortcut connections, a 3D DCNN with dense connections, and the checkpoint ensemble method is effective for capturing 3D features of nodules and distinguishing nodules between non-nodules.},

Nowadays, researchers are trying different deep learning techniques to increase the performance of CAD systems in lung cancer screening with computed tomography. In this work, we review recent state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and architectures proposed as CAD systems for lung cancer detection. They are divided into two categories—(1) Nodule detection systems, which from the original CT scan detect candidate nodules; and (2) False positive reduction systems, which from a set of given candidate nodules classify them into benign or malignant tumors. The main characteristics of the different techniques are presented, and their performance is analyzed. The CT lung datasets available for research are also introduced.

            We developed and validated a deep learning (DL)-based model using the segmentation method and assessed its ability to detect lung cancer on chest radiographs. Chest radiographs for use as a training dataset and a test dataset were collected separately from January 2006 to June 2018 at our hospital. The training dataset was used to train and validate the DL-based model with five-fold cross-validation. The model sensitivity and mean false positive indications per image (mFPI) were assessed with the independent test dataset. The training dataset included 629 radiographs with 652 nodules/masses and the test dataset included 151 radiographs with 159 nodules/masses. The DL-based model had a sensitivity of 0.73 with 0.13 mFPI in the test dataset. Sensitivity was lower in lung cancers that overlapped with blind spots such as pulmonary apices, pulmonary hila, chest wall, heart, and sub-diaphragmatic space (0.50–0.64) compared with those in non-overlapped locations (0.87). The dice coefficient for the 159 malignant lesions was on average 0.52. The DL-based model was able to detect lung cancers on chest radiographs, with low mFPI.},

	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a major outbreak in more than 150 countries around the world, having a severe impact on the health and life of many people globally. One of the crucial step in ﬁghting COVID-19 is the ability to detect the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the fastest ways to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed speciﬁc abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with COVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We ﬁrst prepare a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease presence were identiﬁed by board-certiﬁed radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 2,000 radiograms was used to train four popular convolutional neural networks, including ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease in the analyzed chest X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining 3,000 images, and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 98\% (± 3\%), while having a speciﬁcity rate of around 90\%. Besides sensitivity and speciﬁcity rates, we also present the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, precision-recall curve, average prediction, and confusion matrix of each model. We also used a technique to generate heatmaps of lung regions potentially infected by COVID-19 and show that the generated heatmaps contain most of the infected areas annotated by our board certiﬁed radiologist. While the achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a larger set of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy rates. The dataset, model implementations (in PyTorch), and evaluations, are all made publicly available for research community at https://github.com/shervinmin/DeepCovid.git c 2020 Elsevier B. V.

	abstract = {Recent work has shown that convolutional networks can be substantially deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain shorter connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less computation to achieve high performance.

The proposed models enhance to classify lung cancer into five different classes. The three transfer learning of CNN architectures were used to train, test, and validate based on the image dataset. The results reveal that the proposed models have performed the classification task for detecting lung cancer. The models achieved an accuracy level of VGG16, ResNet50V2, and DenseNet201 were 62\%, 90\%, and 89\%, respectively. Finally, the ensemble of the three proposed CNN models is created and validated.

	abstract = {Automatic diagnosing lung cancer from Computed Tomography (CT) scans involves two steps: detect all suspicious lesions (pulmonary nodules) and evaluate the wholelung/pulmonary malignancy. Currently, there are many studies about the ﬁrst step, but few about the second step. Since the existence of nodule does not deﬁnitely indicate cancer, and the morphology of nodule has a complicated relationship with cancer, the diagnosis of lung cancer demands careful investigations on every suspicious nodule and integration of information of all nodules. We propose a 3D deep neural network to solve this problem. The model consists of two modules. The ﬁrst one is a 3D region proposal network for nodule detection, which outputs all suspicious nodules for a subject. The second one selects the top ﬁve nodules based on the detection conﬁdence, evaluates their cancer probabilities and combines them with a leaky noisy-or gate to obtain the probability of lung cancer for the subject. The two modules share the same backbone network, a modiﬁed U-net. The over-ﬁtting caused by the shortage of training data is alleviated by training the two modules alternately. The proposed model won the ﬁrst place in the Data Science Bowl 2017 competition. The code has been made publicly available1.},

	abstract = {Roller bearings are some of the most critical and widely used components in rotating machinery. Appearance defect inspection plays a key role in bearing quality control. However, in real industries, bearing defects are usually extremely subtle and have a low probability of occurrence. This leads to distribution discrepancies between the number of positive and negative samples, which makes intelligent data-driven inspection methods difﬁcult to develop and deploy. This paper presents a small data-driven convolution neural network (SDD-CNN) for roller subtle defect inspection via an ensemble method for small data preprocessing. First, label dilation (LD) is applied to solve the problem of an imbalance in class distribution. Second, a semi-supervised data augmentation (SSDA) method is proposed to extend the dataset in a more efﬁcient and controlled way. In this method, a coarse CNN model is trained to generate ground truth class activation and guide the random cropping of images. Third, four variants of the CNN model, namely, SqueezeNet v1.1, Inception v3, VGG-16, and ResNet-18, are introduced and employed to inspect and classify the surface defects of rollers. Finally, a rich set of experiments and assessments is conducted, indicating that these SDD-CNN models, particularly the SDD-Inception v3 model, perform exceedingly well in the roller defect classiﬁcation task with a top-1 accuracy reaching 99.56\%. In addition, the convergence time and classiﬁcation accuracy for an SDD-CNN model achieve signiﬁcant improvement compared to that for the original CNN. Overall, using an SDD-CNN architecture, this paper provides a clear path toward a higher precision and efﬁciency for roller defect inspection in smart manufacturing.},

	abstract = {Recent research on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has focused primarily on improving accuracy. For a given accuracy level, it is typically possible to identify multiple CNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent accuracy, smaller CNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1) Smaller CNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training. (2) Smaller CNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller CNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these advantages, we propose a small CNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet achieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. Additionally, with model compression techniques, we are able to compress SqueezeNet to less than 0.5MB (510× smaller than AlexNet).},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many countries around the world resulting in the need to develop quick and effective screening methods to ease the burden and overcome the limitations of varying healthcare capacities. Given the nature of the disease, the use of Chest X-ray (CXR) medical imaging has proven to be very useful which has prompted the exploration of computer-aided diagnosis tools to augment and assist radiologists. However, recent reports have deemed many of the proposed methods to be impractical for use in real-life applications due to models with poor generalization capabilities, an issue closely related to the quality of current datasets in the CXR domain. Typically, deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based classification systems utilize transfer learning techniques when data is limited. We suggest first training models on publicly available large-scale and CXR specific datasets, such as CheXpert, and using these pretrained weights when initializing the final model. Compared with a CNN pretrained on the more general ImageNet dataset, pretraining on large-scale domain specific data increased the model’s ability to generalize to unseen data.},

	abstract = {Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Its early detection in its nodular form is extremely effective in improving patient survival rate. Deep learning (DL) and especially Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have an important development over the past decade and were largely explored in medical imaging analysis. In this paper, a trending DL model composed of two CNN streams, named Bilinear CNN (B-CNN), was proposed for lung nodules classification on CT scans. In the developed B-CNN model, the pre-trained VGG16 architecture was trained as a feature extractor. It is the most important part of the proposed model in which its effectiveness depends stringently on its performances. Aiming to improve these performances, we address this question: what process leads with the performance improvement of the feature extractors? Transfer learning or Finetuning? To answer this question, two B-CNN models were implemented, in which the first one was based on transfer learning process and the second was based on fine-tuning, using VGG16 networks. A set of experiments was conducted and the results have shown the outperformance of the fine-tuned B-CNN model compared to the transfer learning-based model. Moreover, the proposed B-CNN model was demonstrating its efficiency and viability for the classification of lung nodules in terms of accuracy and AUC compared to existing works.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13335},
	abstract = {Accurate quantiﬁcation of pulmonary nodules can assist the early diagnosis of lung cancer, enhancing patient survival possibilities. A number of nodule segmentation techniques, which rely on a radiologist-provided 3-D volume of interest (VOI) input or the use of a constant region of interest (ROI), are proposed; however, these techniques can only investigate the presence of nodule voxels within the given VOI. Such approaches restrain the solutions to freely investigate the nodule presence outside the given VOI and also include the redundant structures (non-nodule) into VOI, which could lead to inaccurate nodule segmentation. In this work, a novel semi-automated approach for 3-D segmentation of nodule in volumetric computerized tomography (CT) lung scans has been proposed. The technique is segregated into two stages. In the ﬁrst stage, a 2-D ROI containing the nodule is provided as an input to perform a patchwise exploration along the axial axis using a novel adaptive ROI algorithm. This strategy enables the dynamic selection of the ROI in the surrounding slices to investigate the presence of nodules using a Deep Residual U-Net architecture. This stage provides the initial estimation of the nodule utilized to extract the VOI. In the second stage, the extracted VOI is further explored along the coronal and sagittal axes with two networks . All the estimated masks are then fed into a consensus module to produce a ﬁnal volumetric segmentation of the nodule. The proposed approach is rigorously evaluated on LIDC-IDRI dataset, which is the largest publicly available dataset. The results suggest that the proposed approach is more robust and accurate than the previous stateof-the-art techniques.},

In the experiment, we used the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) film review forum as the dataset. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and the corresponding variants of RNN (Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)) are analyzed and compared from the theoretical aspect. Moreover, we introduced a bidirectional mechanism to optimize RNN and reduce the influence of parameter changes on model training by comparing specific neural network structures. We found the benefits of LSTM in text classification applications compared with RNN and simple neural networks by comparing experiments. Besides, we explored the role of the bidirectional mechanism for RNN. Finally, we create a two-way LSTM model for text classification model and obtain the model training results indicating less overfitting and less loss than other structures.},

In the last decade, a substantial number of word embedding methods have been proposed for this purpose, mainly falling into the categories of classic and context-based word embeddings. In this paper, we conduct controlled experiments to systematically examine both classic and contextualised word embeddings for the purposes of text classification. To encode a sequence from word representations, we apply two encoders, namely CNN and BiLSTM, in the downstream network architecture. To study the impact of word embeddings on different datasets, we select four benchmarking classification datasets with varying average sample length, comprising both single-label and multi-label classification tasks. The evaluation results with confidence intervals indicate that CNN as the downstream encoder outperforms BiLSTM in most situations, especially for document context-insensitive datasets. This study recommends choosing CNN over BiLSTM for document classification datasets where the context in sequence is not as indicative of class membership as sentence datasets. For word embeddings, concatenation of multiple classic embeddings or increasing their size does not lead to a statistically significant difference in performance despite a slight improvement in some cases. For context-based embeddings, we studied both ELMo and BERT. The results show that BERT overall outperforms ELMo, especially for long document datasets. Compared with classic embeddings, both achieve an improved performance for short datasets while the improvement is not observed in longer datasets.},

	abstract = {Text classiﬁcation is a pivotal task in NLP (Natural Language Processing), which has received widespread attention recently. Most of the existing methods leverage the power of deep learning to improve the performance of models. However, these models ignore the interaction information between all the sentences in a text when generating the current text representation, which results in a partial semantics loss. Labels play a central role in text classiﬁcation. And the attention learned from text-label in the joint space of labels and words is not leveraged, leaving enough room for further improvement. In this paper, we propose a text classiﬁcation method based on Self-Interaction attention mechanism and label embedding. Firstly, our method introduce BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers) to extract text features. Then Self-Interaction attention mechanism is employed to obtain text representations containing more comprehensive semantics. Moreover, we focus on the embedding of labels and words in the joint space to achieve the dual-label embedding, which further leverages the attention learned from text-label. Finally, the texts are classiﬁed by the classiﬁer according to the weighted labels representations. The experimental results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy.},

In this paper, we propose a hierarchical fine-tuning based approach for hierarchical text classification. We use the ordered neurons LSTM (ONLSTM) model by combining the embedding of text and parent category for hierarchical text classification with a large number of categories, which makes full use of the connection between the upper-level and lower-level labels.

This paper proposes a multi-feature fusion method with attention mechanism for long text classification. Long text can be regarded as a hierarchical structure of sentences composed of words and paragraphs composed of sentences. Firstly, sentences are encoded and attention mechanism is introduced to aggregate into sentence level representation according to the different contributions of words. Then, based on the contribution of sentence level, aggregate the representation of growing text level. In sentence coding, based on the global target vector, convolutional neural network is used to extract the local features of words and average representation features of words, so as to further enhance the semantic representation of text. Finally, the important information features of long text content are fused and classified in the linear layer. The experimental results on manually processed THUCNews data show that the model has excellent classification performance in long text data with hierarchical structure, and the classification accuracy can reach 0.952.},

	abstract = {Text classification has been recognized as an essential technique for handling and organizing text data. However, the classic text classifiers cannot clearly describe the difference between relevant and irrelevant information because of uncertainty. The underlying reason is that it is very hard for most text classifiers to explicitly describe the large uncertain boundary between two classes. A three-way decisions based framework is an interesting methodology for dealing with uncertainties in binary classification. However, it is not easy to effectively integrate the framework with a popular classifier (e.g. SVM). By integrating the distinct aspects of three-way decisions theory and the capacities of a support vector machine (SVM), a Multiple-SVMs classifier is proposed in this paper to address this issue. The proposed approach starts from the strategy of partitioning the training set into three regions, namely, positive, negative and boundary regions, to ensure the certainty of extracted knowledge for describing relevant information. Based on these three regions, an innovative and effective probabilistic feature-weighting approach has been proposed to accurately weight the representative terms. The model then organizes training samples to design a MultipleSVMs classifier which is capable of predicting the classes of each document. Experimental results on the standard datasets RCV1 and R21578 show that the proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in different popular measures.},

	abstract = {The threat of online abuse and harassment is increasing day by day in the cyber community. To tackle this problem, many platforms have devised policies. But these policies require prior identification of the content that is inappropriate and offensive. Furthermore, the data contains various aspects of negativity, for example, a particular piece of comment can express, disgust, disbelief, and threat at the same time. It points that even the negativity/toxicity exhibited in a comment can have various facets. Hence, the challenge is to identify what exactly is exhibited in comments so that respective policies can be formulated and applied to penalize the offender. This study makes use of two approaches to identify these underlying toxicities in the comments. The first approach is to train separate classifiers against each facet of the toxicity in comments. The second approach deals with the problem as a multi-label classification problem. Different machine learning approaches including logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and decision tree classification are employed to carry out this study. The dataset is taken from Kaggle and 10-fold cross-validation is used to report the robustness of the model. The study uses a novel preprocessing scheme that transforms the multi-label classification problem into the multi-class classification problem. The preprocessing strategy has shown a significant improvement in the accuracies when employed for simple classification models encouraging its use for other sophisticated models as well. Experimental results show that in both the binary classification and the multi-classification, logistic regression turns out to be a better performer. This indicates the potential use of the preprocessing for the neural classification models.},

	abstract = {Aiming at the problem of sparse Chinese text features and mixing of long and short texts, which lead to the difﬁculty of extracting word vector features and the single convolution kernel of traditional neural network and redundant parameters, the ACL-RoBERTa-CNN text classiﬁcation model uses a contrast learning method to learn a uniformly distributed vector representation in order to achieve the effect of regular expression of space. Input the same sentence into dropout twice as “positive pairs”, replacing the traditional data enhancement method. Use the contrast learned RoBERTa pre-training model to train the word vector, send the word vector to the CNN layer, use different size convolution kernels to capture the information of different length words in each piece of data, ﬁnally combine with Softmax the classiﬁer classiﬁes the extracted features. The experimental results on two public data sets show that ACL-RoBERTa-CNN classiﬁcation performance is better than TextCNN, TextRNN, LSTM-ATT, RoBERTa-LSTM, RoBERTaCNN and other deep learning text classiﬁcation models.},

	abstract = {Text classification is a fundamental task of natural language processing. The convolutional neural network (CNN) has been employed popularly and achieved excellent results on text classification. Nevertheless, the training parameters of CNN is prone to overfitting in the training process, which limits the performance of the convolutional neural network. Adversarial training is an effective regularization method to restrain overfitting to make the model robust against the worst perturbation. In this article, adversarial training is proposed in the convolutional neural network for text classification. In our model, the perturbation is applied to the word embedding layer, not the original input. We implement training and verification on five benchmark datasets. Our experiments indicate that the classifier with adversarial training performs better resisting small perturbation and effectively controls the overfitting. We also analyzed the influence of norm constraint parameters on the classifier and make the model find the appropriate parameters.},

Most of the existing short text classification algorithms usually do not understand the deep semantic information related to the medical field and lack the feature extraction of medical proprietary vocabulary. Traditional models often extract features from context information, which is limited by the lack of access to global and deep semantic information. This paper presents a short text classification algorithm for Chinese clinical medicine combining ALBERT pre-training model and graph attention network. The ALBERT pre-training model is used to represent the feature vectors of the short text of the problem, and then the graphical structure data is generated from the feature vectors. GAT is used to assign different weights to each node in a uniform neighborhood. Finally, a map-level semantic representation for category prediction is generated.

In contrast to previous studies that only focus on different sentiment analysis models, our paper also highlights the use of different APIs to preprocess the data and their corresponding model performance. The results show that no matter which API we choose, Random Forest models always perform the best. However, in terms of training time, Naive Bayes is the fastest.

Logistic regression is a linear model that is easy to implement in classification problems but has poor performance on nonlinear data. The support vector machine algorithm is a linear algorithm that performs well in higher dimensions, but it requires significant time to process.

XMTC can be found in many real-world applications, such as document tagging and product annotation. Recently, deep learning models have achieved outstanding performances in XMTC tasks. However, these deep XMTC models ignore the useful correlation information among different labels. CorNet addresses this limitation by adding an extra CorNet module at the prediction layer of a deep model, which is able to learn label correlations, enhance raw label predictions with correlation knowledge and output augmented label predictions. We show that CorNet can be easily integrated with deep XMTC models and generalize effectively across different datasets. We further demonstrate that CorNet can bring significant improvements over the existing deep XMTC models in terms of both performance and convergence rate.

To train high-performing models with the minimal annotation cost, active learning is proposed to select and label the most informative samples, yet it is still challenging to measure informativeness of samples used in DNNs. In this paper, inspired by piece-wise linear interpretability of DNNs, we propose a novel Active Learning with DivErse iNterpretations (ALDEN) approach. With local interpretations in DNNs, ALDEN identifies linearly separable regions of samples. Then, it selects samples according to their diversity of local interpretations and queries their labels. To tackle the text classification problem, we choose the word with the most diverse interpretations to represent the whole sentence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALDEN consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art deep active learning methods.},

Based on the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) model, the proposed method looks for the appropriate perturbations to generate the adversarial texts through controlling the perturbation direction vectors. Meanwhile, we apply adversarial training to regularize the classiﬁcation model and extend it to semi-supervised tasks with virtual adversarial training. Experiments are conducted to show that the generated adversaries are interpretable and confused to humans and the virtual adversarial training effectively improves the robustness of the model.},

Signi cant progress has been made in recent years by the development of new machine learning methods, such as tree induction with large-margin partitions of the instance spaces and label-vector embedding in the target space. However, deep learning has not been explored for XMTC, despite its big successes in other related areas. is paper presents the rst a empt at applying deep learning to XMTC, with a family of new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models which are tailored for multi-label classi cation in particular. With a comparative evaluation of 7 state-of-the-art methods on 6 benchmark datasets where the number of labels is up to 670,000, we show that the proposed CNN approach successfully scaled to the largest datasets, and consistently produced the best or the second best results on all the datasets. On the Wikipedia dataset with over 2 million documents and 500,000 labels in particular, it outperformed the second best method by 11.7\% ∼ 15.3\% in precision@K and by 11.5\% ∼ 11.7\% in NDCG@K for K = 1,3,5.},

Feature selection is an essential and effective preprocess to enhance the learning process. Choosing a Multi-Label Feature Selection (MLFS) algorithm is the most basic, critical, and sensitive choice in ML classification operations. If this choice is based on a criterion, it cannot be attributed to always being sound. Choosing the best algorithm must be evaluated using several different criteria to be examined from different aspects. In this article, we turn the issue into an election and use the Weighted Borda Count method for voting. We do the voting in three stages continuously so that a subset of different features does the voting. In the second stage, voting of different methods is done with six criteria, and each criterion selects the methods in order of priority from the beginning to the end. Voting steps 1 and 2 are performed on eighteen text datasets used. Finally, in the final voting stage, the methods are evaluated and voted on by different text datasets. The final result of the voting in the third stage shows the desired MLFS methods based on their performance from beginning to end. According to the experiments performed and the results obtained, it can be seen that the selection of the algorithm based on several different criteria and considering the overall performance of the algorithm will be better than the selection based on one criterion.},

Embeddings of different kinds have recently become the de facto standard as features used for text classification. These embeddings have the capacity to capture meanings of words inferred from occurrences in large external collections. While they are built out of external collections, they are unaware of the distributional characteristics of words in the classification dataset at hand, including most importantly the distribution of words across classes in training data. To make the most of these embeddings as features and to boost the performance of classifiers using them, we introduce a weighting scheme, Term Frequency-Category Ratio (TF-CR), which can weight high-frequency, category-exclusive words higher when computing word embeddings. Our experiments on eight datasets show the effectiveness of TF-CR, leading to improved performance scores over the well-known weighting schemes TF-IDF and KLD as well as over the absence of a weighting scheme in most cases.},

In this paper, we propose a method of few-shot text classification based on external knowledge expansion and two strategies of expansion to supervise richer information during training and prediction, by leveraging WordNet and pre-trained model BERT. We split texts into sentences, develop techniques to select terms to semantically expand sentences based on knowledge and measure the text instance representation after knowledge expansion. In this way, we find the method is capable of improving the performance on the task of few-shot text classification. We evaluate our method on two English text classification datasets - IMDB and ASRS across a range of training set sizes. Experiment results show that by knowledge expansion, our method is robust and yields better or comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods on both datasets, which achieves 2.7\% relative improvement compared with previous method on the ASRS test set with the training set size of 380.},

Deep neural networks are becoming more and more popular in text classification due to their expressive power and low requirements for feature engineering. However, the more flexible graph convolutional neural network is rarely used for this task. This paper proposes a text classification model (GENET) based on graph convolution word embedding and attention mechanism. The model can better combine the semantic and lexical information of the text with the discontinuous global word co-occurrence information and long-distance semantic information in the corpus. It breaks the shortcomings of traditional neural networks that have limited structure and can only learn local information. Experimental results show that our proposed text classification method out performs other models on multiple datasets. At the same time, it is proved through experiments that the word global information obtained by GCN is an important supplement to the word embedding representation.},

The application uses machine learning to continuously ﬁt automatic classiﬁcation models that are in turn used to actively support its users with classiﬁcation suggestions. The key requirement we have established for the development of ICS is to give its users total freedom of action: they can at any time modify any classiﬁcation schema and any label assignment, possibly reusing any relevant information from previous activities. We investigate how this requirement challenges the typical scenarios faced in machine learning research, which instead give no active role to humans or place them into very constrained roles, e.g., on-demand labeling in active learning processes, and always assume some degree of batch processing of data. We satisfy the ‘‘total freedom’’ requirement by designing an unobtrusive machine learning model, i.e., the machine learning component of ICS acts as an unobtrusive observer of the users, that never interrupts them, continuously adapts and updates its models in response to their actions, and it is always available to perform automatic classiﬁcations. Our efﬁcient implementation of the unobtrusive machine learning model combines various machine learning methods and technologies, such as hash-based feature mapping, random indexing, online learning, active learning, and asynchronous processing.},

Bert is one of the remarkably rewarding deep learning models that is employed in a variety of NLP classiﬁcation tasks such as intent and topic detection, question answering, sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and so on. Plenty of studies have implemented different models of classiﬁcation using pretrained Bert models. Fine-tuning is done by adding either a simple fully connected layer, BiLSTM, convolutional layers, or a combination of them. Each of those models has ﬁnetuned Bert for a speciﬁc task. The results do not always approve neither the efﬁciency of using complex ﬁne-tuned models of Bert nor the generalization of them. In this study, we extensively inspected various Bert-based ﬁne-tuning models for different text classiﬁcation tasks. Several types of ﬁnetuning Bert models varying in their classiﬁcation layer are implemented and the performance of them is meticulously investigated. The implemented ﬁne-tuning models are using alternatively deep learning networks such as convolutional networks and BiLSTM. The output layer of each model is studied to receive entirely varying inputs coming from the distinct layers of Bert. We conducted considerable experiments to ﬁnd the most general outperforming model. We discover that adding a simple dense layer to the pre-trained Bert model, as a classiﬁer, surpasses other types of deep neural network layers in the investigated tasks. We examine different values of hyperparameters to ﬁnd the optimized combination providing the highest performance.},

However, few of studies have been conducted on the relations among the labels. Most of existing methods tend to neglect the semantic information between labels and words. In this paper, we propose a label-aware network to obtain both the label correlation and text representation. A heterogeneous graph is built from words and labels to learn the label representation by metapath2vec, since two nearby labels or words in the graph have similar relation and the graph structure is beneﬁcial for label representation as well. Each part of the text contributes differently to label inference, therefore bidirectional attention ﬂow is exploited for label-aware text representation in two directions: from text to label and from label to text. Experimental evaluations illustrate that the proposed method outperforms various baselines on both ofﬂine benchmarks and real-world online systems.},

The attention mechanisms usually are used to measure the weights of words to improve predictive performance, but we attempt to achieve the same goal in a simple way. Since that word embedding can capture semantic regularities between words. we introduce a text representation based on label by embedding each label and the word vectors in the same space in this paper. In this label-based text representation, each word has weight information of the number of classes, which play an important role in the final performance. So we proposed a labelbased convolutional neural network (LBCNN) to obtain the importance of different word in the label-based text sequence and the most influential semantic features in the word vector respectively.

	abstract = {Obtaining high-quality labelled data for training a classifier in a new application domain is often costly.
              Transfer Learning
              (a.k.a. “Inductive Transfer”) tries to alleviate these costs by transferring, to the “target” domain of interest, knowledge available from a different “source” domain. In transfer learning the lack of labelled information from the target domain is compensated by the availability at training time of a set of unlabelled examples from the target distribution.
              Transductive Transfer Learning
              denotes the transfer learning setting in which the only set of target documents that we are interested in classifying is known and available at training time. Although this definition is indeed in line with Vapnik’s original definition of “transduction”, current terminology in the field is confused. In this article, we discuss how the term “transduction” has been misused in the transfer learning literature, and propose a clarification consistent with the original characterization of this term given by Vapnik. We go on to observe that the above terminology misuse has brought about misleading experimental comparisons, with inductive transfer learning methods that have been incorrectly compared with transductive transfer learning methods. We then, give empirical evidence that the difference in performance between the inductive version and the transductive version of a transfer learning method can indeed be statistically significant (i.e., that knowing at training time the only data one needs to classify indeed gives an advantage). Our clarification allows a reassessment of the field, and of the relative merits of the major, state-of-the-art algorithms for transfer learning in text classification.},

The aim of this paper is to build a model to classify Arabic news and help users get and display the most relevant news to their interests. In this paper, we demonstrate the efficiency of using deep learning models in solving Arabic multi-label text classification problem.

	abstract = {Multi-label text classiﬁcation, which tags a given plain text with the most relevant labels from a label space, is an important task in the natural language process. To diagnose diseases, clinical researchers use a machine-learning algorithm to do multi-label clinical text classiﬁcation. However, conventional machine learning methods can neither capture deep semantic information nor the context of words strictly. Diagnostic information from the EHRs (Electronic Health Records) is mainly constructed by unstructured clinical free text which is an obstacle for clinical feature extraction. Moreover, feature engineering is time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the rapid development of deep learning, we apply neural network models to resolve this problem mentioned above. To favor multi-label classiﬁcation on EHRs, we propose FAMLC-BERT (Feature-level Attention for Multi-label classiﬁcation on BERT) to capture semantic features from different layers. The model uses feature-level attention with BERT to recognize the labels of EHRs. We empirically compared our model with other state-of-the-art models on realworld documents collected from the hospital. Experiments show that our model achieved signiﬁcant improvements compared to other selected benchmarks.},

Taking into account the characteristics of natural language, a hierarchical Transformer-CNN model is constructed to capture the semantic information of different levels of the text at the word and sentence levels using multi-headed self-attention mechanism, and a sentence convolutional neural network was used to extract key semantic features. For the hierarchical Transformer-CNN model we proposed, sufficient experiments have been conducted on the RCV1 and AAPD data sets to verify the model’s effectiveness.},

While existing supervised training of deep learning models for MLTC usually requires a large number of noise-free labeled samples, which is quite expensive and time-consuming or even impractical in the real-world as label annotations are inevitable error-prone. To handle such a situation, we introduce learning multi-label text classification with noisy labels, and propose an end-to-end method called Multi-label Text Classification with Label Correction under Noise (LCN). LCN contains two modules: a label correction module and a classification module. In the label correction module, a group of prototypes for each class is learnt with the help of label semantic and feature information. These prototypes are then used to calculate the similarity between the extracted deep features to correct the labels of each training sample. In the classification module, the classifier combines the original noisy labels and corrected labels of each sample as supervised information to guide the training procedure. The two modules are combined in a unified framework and trained in an alternative manner. Extensive experimental results on two multi-label text benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of LCN and show its advantages to the state-of-art methods.},

To solve above problems, the paper puts forward a model of mutli-level feature fusion based on BERT, which is suitable for the BERT through the hierarchical decomposition of long text. Then CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and stacked BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory) based on attention mechanism are used to capture local and contextual features of text respectively. Finally, various features are spliced for classification task. The experimental results show that the model achieves 97.4\% accuracy and 97.2\% F1 score on THUCNews, 1.2\% accuracy and 1.6\% F1 score higher than that of BERT-CNN, 1.8\% accuracy and 1.4\% F1 score higher than that of BERT-BiLSTM, indicating that our model can significantly improve the effectiveness of news classification.},

However, neural networks need to continuously evolve for managing new arising challenges like increasing task complexity, explainability of decision making processes, expanded problem domains, providing resilient and robust systems etc. One possible enhancement of traditional neural networks constitutes the innovative Capsule Network (CapsNet) technology, which combines the expressiveness of distributed entity representations with an intelligent and interpretable signal propagation, named as routing-by-agreement. Since CapsNets represent a relatively young acquirement, further research is essential for gaining profound knowledge about CapsNet theory and best practices for diverse application areas. This paper wants to contribute to the progress of CapsNets for the task of text classiﬁcation. For this purpose, various research questions about this technology get formulated and experimentally answered with the aid of six selected datasets. In addition, this paper serves as a possible starting point for researchers as well as for practitioners to deal with CapsNets in the text domain, by supplying a survey about its theory, text classiﬁcation basics and the combination of both areas. The analysis results empirically prove the robustness of CapsNets with routing-by-agreement for a wide spectrum of net architectures, datasets and text classiﬁcation tasks. Hence, CapsNets can be viewed as a next-generation neural network technology, which offers high potential as text classiﬁcation method and should be topic of future research.},

	abstract = {With the development of science and technology, it is possible to quickly obtain massive disaster information after the earthquake, but because the earthquake information not only has the characteristics of strong timeliness, but also is always in the process of dynamic change, it can quickly classify and analyze the earthquake information, which is of great significance for earthquake emergency decision-making. In this paper, an earthquake news text intelligent classification model based on the BERT-BiLSTM optimization algorithm is proposed. First, based on the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers) pre-trained model, the algorithm performs a sentence-level feature vector representation of the seismic news text, and enters the feature vector into the BiLSTM layer to extract the global features of the seismic news text, and then enters the SoftMax classifier for classification. Finally, the control experiment of earthquake news text data in Qinghai and Yunnan was passed. Experimental results show that the model is improved by 2 percentage points compared with the traditional Bert model method. Therefore, the intelligent classification model of earthquake information text proposed in this paper can effectively and accurately determine the category of earthquake news and help earthquake emergency rescue decision-making.},

However, in the actual research, the sample data is small and the distribution of crime categories is not balanced.

In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a BiLSTM-WSAttention model. The neural network model of BiLSTM-WSAttention is used to classify text. The BiLSTM-WSAttention neural network model combines the context of words and sentences, and extracts contextual semantic information from two perspectives: front to back and back to front. At the same time, this article introduces an attention mechanism. Since text is composed of sentences, sentences are composed of words, and the importance of words and sentences depends on context information, so this article includes word-level attention mechanisms and sentence-level. The attention mechanism assigns different weight values to different words and sentences. Finally, the method proposed in this article is compared with the classification methods of NaiveBayes, CNN, RNN, and BLSTM on the same data set. The experimental results show that: Compared with other classification methods, the neural network model BiLSTMWSAttention proposed in this article is effective on this data set.},

However, in many cases, these two premises are not true. If a classification model already exists and classifies data from a domain well, then a classification task for a related domain exists, but only data from the source domain, then it may violate this assumption. The comment text classification method based on transfer learning refers to applying the classification knowledge learned in the source domain to the new classification task in the relevant field by using the transfer learning method in the process of classifying the comment text. Therefore, after constructing the isomorphic feature space of source domain and target domain, the TrAdaBoost migration learning framework was used to train the classification model. This model allows users to leverage old data with a small amount of new markup data to build a high-quality classification model for new data. Experimental results show that the model can effectively transfer classification knowledge from source domain to target domain.},

	abstract = {The issue of sentiment classiﬁcation in short-term and small-scale data scenarios is considered in this paper. It is a hot topic because the text sentiment classiﬁcation task in the public opinion analysis scene has two characteristics: short time and small data scale. Existing work focused on improving the accuracy at the cost of data and training time, without considering scenarios where time and data are lacked. The most commonly used method to solve the problem of small data scale is to use multi-modal information such as pictures, sounds and videos, which will lead to unbearable training time. The shorter training time determines that the classiﬁcation model is generally selected as a deep neural network with fewer layers, such as TextCNN, TextRNN, and so on. However, such models are limited by the structure and have a low classiﬁcation accuracy. In order to solve both short-term and small-scale data problems, a common information user attribute on social media is added to the model as multimodal information, which includes twelve attributes such as user age, location, and posting time. This paper proposed a sentiment classiﬁcation algorithm based on multi-modal social media text information. The algorithm makes use of parallel convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) to process text information and user attributes respectively, and combines the feature vectors of the two models for classiﬁcation, which is called User attributes Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Network (UCRNN). The addition of user attributes can improve accuracy, and the CNN network used to extract user attributes features has fewer parameters, which proves that the algorithm can achieve high accuracy under short-term and small-scale data. Experiments verify that the training time of this model is slightly less than TextRNN. The classiﬁcation accuracy can reach 90.2\%, which is the state-of-the-art in the ﬁeld of short-term and smallscale data sentiment classiﬁcation.},

This paper presents a short text classification method based on Cross-connected GRU Kernel Mapping Support Vector Machine (C-GRUKMSVM), to further improve the accuracy of short text classification. The method consists of a feature mapping module and a classification module. The feature mapping module first represents the text as a word vector using the glove method, and then explicitly maps the low-dimensional word vector to a high-dimensional space using a three-layer cross-connected GRU; the classification module uses a soft-margin support vector machine for classification. Experimental results on five publicly available short text datasets show that C-GRUKMSVM achieves better text classification performance than convolutional networks, support vector machines and Naïve Bayes. Additionally, different crossconnected methods, recurrent units and recurrent structures have an impact on the performance of C-GRUKMSVM.},

Each technique was used to train a number of state-of-the-art classifiers, and the results have been compiled and presented.

For example, the input text could be a product description on Amazon.com and the labels could be product categories. XMC is an important yet challenging problem in the NLP community. Recently, deep pretrained transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many NLP tasks including sentence classification, albeit with small label sets. However, naively applying deep transformer models to the XMC problem leads to sub-optimal performance due to the large output space and the label sparsity issue. In this paper, we propose X-Transformer, the first scalable approach to fine-tuning deep transformer models for the XMC problem. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on four XMC benchmark datasets. In particular, on a Wiki dataset with around 0.5 million labels, the prec@1 of X-Transformer is 77.28\%, a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art XMC approaches Parabel (linear) and AttentionXML (neural), which achieve 68.70\% and 76.95\% precision@1, respectively. We further apply XTransformer to a product2query dataset from Amazon and gained 10.7\% relative improvement on prec@1 over Parabel.},

	abstract = {Text classiﬁcation and Topic Modelling is the backbone for the text analysis of huge amount of corpus of data. With an increase in unstructured data around us , it is very difﬁcult to analyse the data very easily.There is a need for some methods that can be applied to the data to get the sensitive and semantic information from the corpus. Text classiﬁcation is categorization of text in organised way for the interpretation of sensitive information from the text , while Topic modelling is ﬁnding the abstract topic for the collection of text or document. Topic modelling is used frequently to ﬁnd semantic information from the textual data. In this paper we applied Parsing techniques on various websites to extract the HTML and XML data which includes the textual data and also applied Preprocessing techniques to clean the data.For the text classiﬁcation purpose some of the Machine learning based classiﬁers that we have used in our experiment are Naive Bayes and also Logistic Regression Classiﬁer .The models of the document are built using three different topic modelling methods which are Latent Semantic Analysis , Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation.In the further experiment we have done analysis and also comparison based upon the performance of the models and classiﬁers on the processed textual data.},

Usually, these graph-like data will be inputted into some certain artificial neutral networks which are dramatically disparate with the conventional CNN. The purpose of the algorithm employed the GNN is to extract much more detailed features that can be stored easily in the graph. However, these detailed features are much more difficult to extract in the raw data accumulated in the database, which requires the experiment to transfer the common database into the whole graph ahead of schedule. The dataset used in this paper, Cora, is commonly used in some papers whose targets aimed at semantic segmentation, while disparate with this paper as well. The result of this experiment has achieved to nearly 100\% accuracy accompanied with those preprocessed data. Furthermore, this paper also attaches much focus on the effects of preprocessing operation which can be reflected on the differences of accuracy. Only by preprocessing operation can this paper achieve better results accompanied with higher accuracy when compared with other experiments.},

Secondly, BiGRU was used to extract the context features of the text, and attention mechanism was used after BiGRU to extract the attention score of the output information. Finally, the output of BiGRU attention was fused with the output of CNN to realize the effective extraction of text features and focused on the important content words.

	abstract = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining. Empirically, under comparable experiment settings, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large margin, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.},

            Text preprocessing is not only an essential step to prepare the corpus for modeling but also a key area that directly affects the natural language processing (NLP) application results. For instance, precise tokenization increases the accuracy of part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and retaining multiword expressions improves reasoning and machine translation. The text corpus needs to be appropriately preprocessed before it is ready to serve as the input to computer models. The preprocessing requirements depend on both the nature of the corpus and the NLP application itself, that is, what researchers would like to achieve from analyzing the data. Conventional text preprocessing practices generally suffice, but there exist situations where the text preprocessing needs to be customized for better analysis results. Hence, we discuss the pros and cons of several common text preprocessing methods: removing formatting, tokenization, text normalization, handling punctuation, removing stopwords, stemming and lemmatization, n-gramming, and identifying multiword expressions. Then, we provide examples of text datasets which require special preprocessing and how previous researchers handled the challenge. We expect this article to be a starting guideline on how to select and fine-tune text preprocessing methods.},

This technology to analyze and score essays automatically is a hot spot for the application of natural language processing in the field of education. Firstly, different encoding methods are used to obtain the lexical vectors of the text. Secondly, features of the seven aspects of the text are fully extracted. Then the comparative analysis of different ensemble learning models was studied on the English essay scoring competition dataset of Kaggle. Finally, a model based on the stacking method is proposed. The results show that the model based on the stacking method achieves the best results on all datasets. It improves the average QWK values on eight subsets by 1.0\%∼2.8\% compared to the baseline models of neural networks and feature-engineered.},

	abstract = {The task of automated essay scoring (AES) continues to attract interdisciplinary attention due to its commercial and educational importance as well as related research challenges. Traditional AES approaches rely on handcrafted features, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Neural network approaches have recently given fantastic results in AES without feature engineering, but they usually require extensive annotated data. Moreover, most of the existing AES models only report a single holistic score without providing diagnostic information about various dimensions of writing quality. Focusing on these issues, we develop a novel approach using multi-task learning (MTL) with ﬁne-tuning Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for multi-dimensional AES tasks. As a state-of-theart pre-trained language model, a BERT-based approach can improve AES tasks with limited training data. Meanwhile, we deal with long texts by proposing a hierarchical method and using the attention mechanism to automatically determine the contribution of different fractions of the input essay to the ﬁnal score. For the multi-topic essay scoring tasks on the ASAP dataset, results reveal that our approach outperforms the average quadratic weighted Kappa (QWK) score by 4.5\% compared with the strong baseline. We propose a self-collected dataset of Chinese EFL Learners’ Argumentation (CELA) to provide valuable information about writing quality from multiple rating dimensions, including holistic and ﬁve analytic scales. For the multi-rating dimensional essay scoring tasks on the CELA dataset, experimental results demonstrate that our model increases the average QWK score by 8.1\% compared with the strong baseline.},

The effectiveness of automated essay scoring (AES) is thus holding a strong appeal to universities for managing an increasing learning interest and reducing costs associated with human raters. The growth in e-learning systems in the higher education system and the demand for consistent writing assessments has spurred research interest in improving the accuracy of AES systems. This paper presents a transformer-based neural network model for improved AES performance using Bi-LSTM and RoBERTa language model based on Kaggle’s ASAP dataset. The proposed model uses Bi-LSTM model over pre-trained RoBERTa language model to address the coherency issue in essays that is ignored by traditional essay scoring methods, including traditional NLP pipelines, deep learning-based methods, a mixture of both. The comparison of the experimental results on essay scoring with human raters concludes that the proposed model outperforms the existing methods in essay scoring in terms of QWK score. The comparative analysis of results demonstrates the applicability of the proposed model in automated essay scoring at higher education level.},

Essay assessment takes a long time if corrected manually. Therefore, researches on automatic essay scoring have been growing rapidly in recent years. The method that is usually used for automatic essay scoring is Cosine Similarity by utilizing bag of words as the feature extraction. However, the feature extraction by using bag of words did not consider to the order of words in a sentence. Meanwhile, the order of words in an essay has an important role in the assessment. In this study, an automatic essay scoring system based on n-gram and cosine similarity was proposed. N-gram was used for feature extraction and modified to split by word instead of by letter so that the word order would be considered. Based on evaluation results, this system got the best correlation of 0.66 by using unigram on questions that do not consider the order of words in the answer. For questions that consider the order of the words in the answer, bigram has the best correlation value by 0.67.},

	abstract = {Educational institutions often assess a student's critical thinking and communication skills based on essay responses. Manual Evaluation is time-consuming, and there may be wide variations when multiple evaluators rate batches of essays. In the last few years, the automated grading of essay scripts has emerged as a new area of research. Most studies essentially focus on visible attributes such as length, vocabulary, sentiment or spelling. The use of neural networks requires the conversion of text into some vector representations. However solely using handcrafted attributes or text encodings implies primarily operating on word granularity. On the other hand, Transformers can handle dependencies between words of the text. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that can capture the interaction of words in the essay using the BERT self-attention transformer, along with handcrafted syntactical features. While previous studies have built individual models for every essay topic, our model has been incrementally trained on multiple essay topics to test its generalizability. The validation of the model uses quadratic weighted kappa to compare human-rated scores and model scores.},

	abstract = {Automated essay scoring (AES) allows writing to be assigned in large courses and can provide instant formative feedback to students. However, creating models for AES can be costly, requiring the collection and human scoring of hundreds of essays. We have developed and are piloting a web-based tool that allows instructors to incrementally score responses to enable AES scoring while minimizing the number of essays the instructors must score. Previous work has shown that techniques from the machine learning subﬁeld of active learning can reduce the amount of training data required to create effective AES models. We extend those results to a less idealized scenario: one driven by the instructor’s need to score sets of essays, in which the model is trained iteratively using batch mode active learning. We propose a novel approach inspired by a class of topological methods, but with reduced computational requirements, which we refer to as topological maxima. Using actual student data, we show that batch mode active learning is a practical approach to training AES models. Finally, we discuss implications of using this technology for automated customized scoring of writing across the curriculum.},

This study compares the performance of three AES models which utilize different text embedding methods, namely Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe), Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). We used two evaluation metrics: Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) and a novel “robustness”, which quantiﬁes the models’ ability to detect adversarial essays created by modifying normal essays to cause them to be less coherent. We found that: (1) the BERTbased model achieved the greatest robustness, followed by the GloVe-based and ELMo-based models, respectively, and (2) ﬁnetuning the embeddings improves QWK but lowers robustness. These ﬁndings could be informative on how to choose, and whether to ﬁne-tune, an appropriate model based on how much the AES program places emphasis on proper grading of adversarial essays.},

However, no prior work has explicitly studied how the sequence of discourse relations inﬂuence a claim’s impact. This paper empirically shows that the discourse relations between two arguments along the context path are essential factors for identifying the persuasive power of an argument. We further propose DISCOC to inject and fuse the sentence-level structural discourse information with contextualized features derived from large-scale language models. Experimental results and extensive analysis show that the attention and gate mechanisms that explicitly model contexts and texts can indeed help the argument impact classiﬁcation task deﬁned by Durmus et al. (2019), and discourse structures among the context path of the claim to be classiﬁed can further boost the performance.},

However, few studies investigated using the prompt information into the neural network. We know that there is a close relevance between the essay content and the topic. Therefore, the relevance between the essay and the topic can aid to represent the relationship between the essay and its score. That is to say, the degree of relevance between the high score essay and the topic will be higher while the low score essay is less similar to the topic. Inspired by this idea, we propose to use the similarity of the essay and the topic as auxiliary information which can be concatenated into the final representation of the essay. We first use a hierarchical recurrent neural network combined with attention mechanism to learn the content representation of the essay and the topic on sentence-level and document-level. Then, we multiply the essay representation and the topic representation to get a similarity representation between them. In the end, we concatenate the similarity representation into the essay’s representation to get a final representation of the essay. We tested our model on ASAP dataset and the experimental results show that our model outperformed the existing state-of-the-art models.},

Our approach leverages a structured LSTM module to compute a text representation that reflects the composition of discourse units in the rhetorical structure. We show that: (i) the inclusion of discourse analysis improves paragraph-level text classification; (ii) a novel TreeLSTM-based approach performs well for the computation of the complex text hidden representation using both a language model and an end-to-end RST parser; (iii) structures predicted by the proposed RST parser reflect the argumentative structures in texts in Russian.},

Researchers have recently proposed many techniques for automatic evaluation. However, many of these techniques use hand-crafted features and thus are limited from the feature representation point of view. Deep learning has emerged as a new paradigm in machine learning which can exploit the vast data and identify the features useful for essay evaluation. To this end, we propose a novel architecture based on recurrent networks (RNN) and convolution neural network (CNN). In the proposed architecture, the multichannel convolutional layer learns and captures the contextual features of the word n-gram from the word embedding vectors and the essential semantic concepts to form the feature vector at essay level using max-pooling operation. A variant of RNN called Bi-gated recurrent unit (BGRU) is used to access both previous and subsequent contextual representations. The experiment was carried out on eight data sets available on Kaggle for the task of AES. The experimental results show that our proposed system achieves significantly higher grading accuracy than other deep learning-based AES systems and also other state-of-the-art AES systems.},

	abstract = {Traditional automated essay scoring systems rely on carefully designed features to evaluate and score essays. The performance of such systems is tightly bound to the quality of the underlying features. However, it is laborious to manually design the most informative features for such a system. In this paper, we develop an approach based on recurrent neural networks to learn the relation between an essay and its assigned score, without any feature engineering. We explore several neural network models for the task of automated essay scoring and perform some analysis to get some insights of the models. The results show that our best system, which is based on long short-term memory networks, outperforms a strong baseline by 5.6\% in terms of quadratic weighted Kappa, without requiring any feature engineering.},

Existing work used recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks to model input essays, giving grades based on a single vector representation of the essay. On the other hand, the relative advantages of RNNs and CNNs have not been compared. In addition, different parts of the essay can contribute differently for scoring, which is not captured by existing models. We address these issues by building a hierarchical sentence-document model to represent essays, using the attention mechanism to automatically decide the relative weights of words and sentences.

The combined feature set contains 22 features that captures five different aspects of writing qualities. The importance of each feature in the combined feature set is tested by eliminating each feature separately. It was found that using the number of nouns in the essay slightly degrades the AES system performance.

The problem domain is challenging because the open-ended customer-supplied source text has considerable scope for ambiguity and error, making models for analysis hard to build. There is also a need to incorporate specialized business domain knowledge into the intelligent processing systems. To address these challenges, we experimented with and exploited a number of cloud-based machine learning models and composed them into an application-specific processing pipeline. This design allows for modification of the underlying algorithms as more data and improved techniques become available. We describe our design, and the main challenges we faced, namely keeping a check on the quality control of the models, testing the software and deploying the computationally expensive ML models on the cloud.},

Their role is even more crucial nowadays as contemporary argumentation technologies face challenging tasks as misleading and manipulative information detection in news articles and political discourse, and counter-narrative generation. Despite some work in this direction, the issue of classifying arguments as being fallacious largely remains a challenging and an unsolved task. Our contribution is twofold: first, we present a novel annotated resource of 31 political debates from the U.S. Presidential Campaigns, where we annotated six main categories of fallacious arguments (i.e., ad hominem, appeal to authority, appeal to emotion, false cause, slogan, slippery slope) leading to 1628 annotated fallacious arguments; second, we tackle this novel task of fallacious argument classification and we define a neural architecture based on transformers outperforming state-of-the-art results and standard baselines. Our results show the important role played by argument components and relations in this task.},

	abstract = {Digitalization and automation of test administration, score reporting, and feedback provision have the potential to benefit large-scale and formative assessments. Many studies on automated essay scoring (AES) and feedback generation systems were published in the last decade, but few connected AES and feedback generation within a unified framework. Recent advancements in machine learning algorithms enable researchers to develop more models that explore the potential of automated assessments in education. This study makes the following contributions. First, it implements, compares, and contrasts three AES algorithms with word-embedding and deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, and BiLSTM). Second, it proposes a novel automated feedback generation algorithm based on the Constrained MetropolisHastings Sampling (CGMH). Third, it builds a classifier to integrate AES and feedback generation into a systematic framework. Results show that (1) the scoring accuracy of the AES algorithm outperforms that of state-of-the-art models; and (2) the CGMH method generates semantically-related feedback sentences. The findings support the feasibility of an automated system that combines essay scoring with feedback generation. Implications may lead to the development of models that reveal linguistic features, while achieving high scoring accuracy, as well as to the creation of feedback corpora to generate more semantically-related and sentiment-appropriate feedback.},

In this work, we introduce a comprehensive and large dataset named IAM, which can be applied to a series of argument mining tasks, including claim extraction, stance classification, evidence extraction, etc. Our dataset is collected from over 1k articles related to 123 topics. Near 70k sentences in the dataset are fully annotated based on their argument properties (e.g., claims, stances, evidence, etc.). We further propose two new integrated argument mining tasks associated with the debate preparation process: (1) claim extraction with stance classification (CESC) and (2) claim-evidence pair extraction (CEPE). We adopt a pipeline approach and an end-to-end method for each integrated task separately. Promising experimental results are reported to show the values and challenges of our proposed tasks, and motivate future research on argument mining.},

Despite their successes in prompt-dependent AES, how to effectively predict essay ratings under a prompt-independent setting remains a challenge, where the rated essays for the target prompt are not available. To close this gap, a two-stage deep neural network (TDNN) is proposed. In particular, in the ﬁrst stage, using the rated essays for nontarget prompts as the training data, a shallow model is learned to select essays with an extreme quality for the target prompt, serving as pseudo training data; in the second stage, an end-to-end hybrid deep model is proposed to learn a prompt-dependent rating model consuming the pseudo training data from the ﬁrst step. Evaluation of the proposed TDNN on the standard ASAP dataset demonstrates a promising improvement for the prompt-independent AES task.},

	abstract = {Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is a critical text regression task that automatically assigns scores to essays based on their writing quality. Recently, the performance of sentence prediction tasks has been largely improved by using Pre-trained Language Models via fusing representations from different layers, constructing an auxiliary sentence, using multitask learning, etc. However, to solve the AES task, previous works utilize shallow neural networks to learn essay representations and constrain calculated scores with regression loss or ranking loss, respectively. Since shallow neural networks trained on limited samples show poor performance to capture deep semantic of texts. And without an accurate scoring function, ranking loss and regression loss measures two different aspects of the calculated scores. To improve AES’s performance, we ﬁnd a new way to ﬁne-tune pre-trained language models with multiple losses of the same task. In this paper, we propose to utilize a pretrained language model to learn text representations ﬁrst. With scores calculated from the representations, mean square error loss and the batch-wise ListNet loss with dynamic weights constrain the scores simultaneously. We utilize Quadratic Weighted Kappa to evaluate our model on the Automated Student Assessment Prize dataset. Our model outperforms not only state-of-the-art neural models near 3 percent but also the latest statistic model. Especially on the two narrative prompts, our model performs much better than all other state-of-theart models.},

	title = {Neural {Automated} {Essay} {Scoring} {Incorporating} {Handcrafted} {Features}},
	abstract = {Automated essay scoring (AES) is the task of automatically assigning scores to essays as an alternative to grading by human raters. Conventional AES typically relies on handcrafted features, whereas recent studies have proposed AES models based on deep neural networks (DNNs) to obviate the need for feature engineering. Furthermore, hybrid methods that integrate handcrafted features in a DNN-AES model have been recently developed and have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy. One of the most popular hybrid methods is formulated as a DNN-AES model with an additional recurrent neural network (RNN) that processes a sequence of handcrafted sentencelevel features. However, this method has the following problems: 1) It cannot incorporate effective essay-level features developed in previous AES research. 2) It greatly increases the numbers of model parameters and tuning parameters, increasing the difﬁculty of model training. 3) It has an additional RNN to process sentence-level features, enabling extension to various DNN-AES models complex. To resolve these problems, we propose a new hybrid method that integrates handcrafted essay-level features into a DNN-AES model. Speciﬁcally, our method concatenates handcrafted essay-level features to a distributed essay representation vector, which is obtained from an intermediate layer of a DNN-AES model. Our method is a simple DNN-AES extension, but signiﬁcantly improves scoring accuracy.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has demonstrated tremendous potential for Automatic Text Scoring (ATS) tasks. In this paper, we describe a new neural architecture that enhances vanilla neural network models with auxiliary neural coherence features. Our new method proposes a new {\textbackslash}textsc\{SkipFlow\} mechanism that models relationships between snapshots of the hidden representations of a long short-term memory (LSTM) network as it reads. Subsequently, the semantic relationships between multiple snapshots are used as auxiliary features for prediction. This has two main benefits. Firstly, essays are typically long sequences and therefore the memorization capability of the LSTM network may be insufficient. Implicit access to multiple snapshots can alleviate this problem by acting as a protection against vanishing gradients. The parameters of the {\textbackslash}textsc\{SkipFlow\} mechanism also acts as an auxiliary memory. Secondly, modeling relationships between multiple positions allows our model to learn features that represent and approximate textual coherence. In our model, we call this {\textbackslash}textit\{neural coherence\} features. Overall, we present a unified deep learning architecture that generates neural coherence features as it reads in an end-to-end fashion. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark ASAP dataset, outperforming not only feature engineering baselines but also other deep learning models.},

In recent years, an abundance of research has been done to automate essay evaluation processes, yet little has been done to take into consideration the syntax, semantic coherence and sentiments of the essay’s text together. Our proposed system incorporates not just the rule-based grammar and surface level coherence check but also includes the semantic similarity of the sentences. We propose to use Graph-based relationships within the essay’s content and polarity of opinion expressions. Semantic similarity is determined between each statement of the essay to form these Graph-based spatial relationships and novel features are obtained from it. Our algorithm uses 23 salient features with high predictive power, which is less than the current systems while considering every aspect to cover the dimensions that a human grader focuses on. Fewer features help us get rid of the redundancies of the data so that the predictions are based on more representative features and are robust to noisy data. The prediction of the scores is done with neural networks using the data released by the ASAP competition held by Kaggle. The resulting agreement between human grader’s score and the system’s prediction is measured using Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). Our system produces a QWK of 0.793.},

Despite the regularity in which syntactic complexity measures have been employed, the construct is still relatively under-developed, and, as a result, the cumulative results of syntactic complexity studies can appear opaque. At least three reasons exist for the current state of affairs, namely the lack of consistency and clarity by which indices of syntactic complexity have been described, the overly broad nature of the indices that have been regularly employed, and the omission of indices that focus on usage-based perspectives. This study seeks to address these three gaps through the development and validation of the Tool for the Automatic Assessment of Syntactic Sophistication and Complexity (TAASSC). TAASSC measures large and fined grained clausal and phrasal indices of syntactic complexity and usage-based frequency/contingency indices of syntactic sophistication. Using TAASSC, this study will address L2 writing development in two main ways: through the examination of syntactic development longitudinally and through the examination of human judgments of writing proficiency (e.g., expert ratings of TOEFL essays). This study will have important implications for second language acquisition, second language writing, and language assessment.},

	abstract = {When English Learners (ELs) demonstrate English language proficiency, they are reclassified as Fluent English Proficient (RFEP). Subsequently they are often left out of the analysis of EL progress because they are, technically, no longer ELs. This article examines the effects of including and excluding RFEPs from the analysis of EL progress. Based on statewide achievement data from California including ELs, RFEPs, IELs (all initially identified English Learners: ELs + RFEPs), and English-only students (EOs), the analysis demonstrates that focusing on current ELs and excluding RFEPs (a) underestimates the population of IELs, (b) overestimates the achievement gap between IELs and EOs, and (c) decreases the likelihood of detecting progress when positive changes in achievement have taken place over time. Implications are discussed.},

	title = {Automated assessment of {English}-learner writing},
	url = {https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-842.html},
	abstract = {In this thesis, we investigate automated assessment (AA) systems of free text that automatically analyse and score the quality of writing of learners of English as a second (or other) language. Previous research has employed techniques that measure, in addition to writing competence, the semantic relevance of a text written in response to a given prompt. We argue that an approach which does not rely on task-dependent components or data, and directly assesses learner English, can produce results as good as prompt-specific models. Furthermore, it has the advantage that it may not require re-training or tuning for new prompts or assessment tasks. We evaluate the performance of our models against human scores, manually annotated in the Cambridge Learner Corpus, a subset of which we have released in the public domain to facilitate further research on the task.

We address AA as a supervised discriminative machine learning problem, investigate methods for assessing different aspects of writing prose, examine their generalisation to different corpora, and present state-of-the-art models. We focus on scoring general linguistic competence and discourse coherence and cohesion, and report experiments on detailed analysis of appropriate techniques and feature types derived automatically from generic text processing tools, on their relative importance and contribution to performance, and on comparison with different discriminative models, whilst also experimentally motivating novel feature types for the task. Using outlier texts, we examine and address validity issues of AA systems and, more specifically, their robustness to subversion by writers who understand something of their workings. Finally, we present a user interface that visualises and uncovers the ‘marking criteria’ represented in AA models, that is, textual features identified as highly predictive of a learner’s level of attainment. We demonstrate how the tool can support their linguistic interpretation and enhance hypothesis formation about learner grammars, in addition to informing the development of AA systems and further improving their performance.},

	abstract = {In linguistics, the grammar of a natural language is its set of structural constraints on speakers' or writers' composition of clauses, phrases, and words. The term can also refer to the study of such constraints, a field that includes domains such as phonology, morphology, and syntax, often complemented by phonetics, semantics, and pragmatics. There are currently two different approaches to the study of grammar: traditional grammar and theoretical grammar.
Fluent speakers of a language variety or lect have effectively internalized these constraints, the vast majority of which – at least in the case of one's native language(s) – are acquired not by conscious study or instruction but by hearing other speakers. Much of this internalization occurs during early childhood; learning a language later in life usually involves more explicit instruction. In this view, grammar is understood as the cognitive information underlying a specific instance of language production.
The term "grammar" can also describe the linguistic behavior of groups of speakers and writers, rather than individuals. Differences in scales are important to this sense of the word: for example, the term "English grammar" could refer to the whole of English grammar (that is, to the grammars of all the speakers of the language), in which case the term encompasses a great deal of variation. At a smaller scale, it may refer only to what is shared among the grammars of all or most English speakers (such as subject–verb–object word order in simple declarative sentences). At the smallest scale, this sense of "grammar" can describe the conventions of just one relatively well-defined form of English (such as standard English for a region).
A description, study, or analysis of such rules may also be referred to as grammar. A reference book describing the grammar of a language is called a "reference grammar" or simply "a grammar" (see History of English grammars). A fully explicit grammar which exhaustively describes the grammatical constructions of a particular speech variety is called descriptive grammar. This kind of linguistic description contrasts with linguistic prescription, an attempt to actively discourage or suppress some grammatical constructions, while codifying and promoting others, either in an absolute sense or about a standard variety. For example, some prescriptivists maintain that sentences in English should not end with prepositions, a prohibition that has been traced to John Dryden (13 April 1668 – January 1688) whose unexplained objection to the practice perhaps led other English speakers to avoid the construction and discourage its use. Yet preposition stranding has a long history in Germanic languages like English, where it is so widespread as to be a standard usage.
Outside linguistics, the term grammar is often used in a rather different sense. It may be used more broadly to include conventions of spelling and punctuation, which linguists would not typically consider as part of grammar but rather as part of orthography, the conventions used for writing a language. It may also be used more narrowly to refer to a set of prescriptive norms only, excluding those aspects of a language's grammar which are not subject to variation or debate on their normative acceptability. Jeremy Butterfield claimed that, for non-linguists, "Grammar is often a generic way of referring to any aspect of English that people object to."},

	abstract = {Background
              Writing composition is a significant factor for measuring test-takers’ ability in any language exam. However, the assessment (scoring) of these writing compositions or essays is a very challenging process in terms of reliability and time. The need for objective and quick scores has raised the need for a computer system that can automatically grade essay questions targeting specific prompts. Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems are used to overcome the challenges of scoring writing tasks by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature for the AES systems used for grading the essay questions.
            
            
              Methodology
              We have reviewed the existing literature using Google Scholar, EBSCO and ERIC to search for the terms “AES”, “Automated Essay Scoring”, “Automated Essay Grading”, or “Automatic Essay” for essays written in English language. Two categories have been identified: handcrafted features and automatically featured AES systems. The systems of the former category are closely bonded to the quality of the designed features. On the other hand, the systems of the latter category are based on the automatic learning of the features and relations between an essay and its score without any handcrafted features. We reviewed the systems of the two categories in terms of system primary focus, technique(s) used in the system, the need for training data, instructional application (feedback system), and the correlation between e-scores and human scores. The paper includes three main sections. First, we present a structured literature review of the available Handcrafted Features AES systems. Second, we present a structured literature review of the available Automatic Featuring AES systems. Finally, we draw a set of discussions and conclusions.
            
            
              Results
              AES models have been found to utilize a broad range of manually-tuned shallow and deep linguistic features. AES systems have many strengths in reducing labor-intensive marking activities, ensuring a consistent application of scoring criteria, and ensuring the objectivity of scoring. Although many techniques have been implemented to improve the AES systems, three primary challenges have been identified. The challenges are lacking of the sense of the rater as a person, the potential that the systems can be deceived into giving a lower or higher score to an essay than it deserves, and the limited ability to assess the creativity of the ideas and propositions and evaluate their practicality. Many techniques have only been used to address the first two challenges.},

	abstract = {Background
              Identification of vertebral fractures (VFs) is critical for effective secondary fracture prevention owing to their association with the increasing risks of future fractures. Plain abdominal frontal radiographs (PARs) are a common investigation method performed for a variety of clinical indications and provide an ideal platform for the opportunistic identification of VF. This study uses a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to identify the feasibility for the screening, detection, and localization of VFs using PARs.
            
            
              Methods
              A DCNN was pretrained using ImageNet and retrained with 1306 images from the PARs database obtained between August 2015 and December 2018. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were evaluated. The visualization algorithm gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was used for model interpretation.
            
            
              Results
              Only 46.6\% (204/438) of the VFs were diagnosed in the original PARs reports. The algorithm achieved 73.59\% accuracy, 73.81\% sensitivity, 73.02\% specificity, and an AUC of 0.72 in the VF identification.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Computer driven solutions integrated with the DCNN have the potential to identify VFs with good accuracy when used opportunistically on PARs taken for a variety of clinical purposes. The proposed model can help clinicians become more efficient and economical in the current clinical pathway of fragile fracture treatment.},

Under such conflicts, reviewers can manipulate their reviews in a strategic manner to influence the final rankings of their own papers. Present-day peer-review systems are not designed to guard against such strategic behavior, beyond minimal (and insufficient) checks such as not assigning a paper to a conflicted reviewer. In this work, we address this problem through the lens of social choice, and present a theoretical framework for strategyproof and efficient peer review. Given the conflict graph which satisfies a simple property, we first present and analyze a flexible framework for reviewer-assignment and aggregation for the reviews that guarantees not only strategyproofness but also a natural efficiency property (unanimity). Our framework is based on the so-called partitioning method, and can be treated as a generalization of this type of method to conference peer review settings. We then empirically show that the requisite property on the (authorship) conflict graph is indeed satisfied in the ICLR-17 submissions data, and further demonstrate a simple trick to make the partitioning method more practically appealing under conference peer-review settings. Finally, we complement our positive results with negative theoretical results where we prove that under slightly stronger requirements, it is impossible for any algorithm to be both strategyproof and efficient.},

Recently, label-specific feature embedding has been proposed to explore label-specific features from the training data, and uses feature highly customized to the multi-label set for learning. While such feature embedding methods have demonstrated good performance, the creation of the feature embedding space is only based on a single label, without considering label correlations in the data. In this article, we propose to combine multiple label-specific feature spaces, using label correlation, for multi-label learning. The proposed algorithm,

After that, MULFE utilizes the label correlation to optimize the margin distribution of the base classifiers which are induced by the related label-specific feature spaces. By combining multiple label-specific features, label correlation based weighting, and ensemble learning, MULFE achieves maximum margin multi-label classification goal through the underlying optimization framework. Empirical studies on 10 public data sets manifest the effectiveness of MULFE.},

	abstract = {Medical imaging AI systems such as disease classification and segmentation are increasingly inspired and transformed from computer vision based AI systems. Although an array of defense techniques have been developed and proved to be effective in computer vision, defending against adversarial attacks on medical images remains largely an uncharted territory due to their unique challenges: 1) label scarcity limits adversarial generalizability; 2) vastly similar and dominant fore- and background make it difficult for learning the discriminating features; and 3) crafted adversarial noises added to a highly standardized medical image can make it a hard sample for model to predict. In this paper, we propose a novel robust medical imaging AI framework based on Semi-Supervised Adversarial Training (SSAT) and Unsupervised Adversarial Detection (UAD), followed by a new measure for assessing systems adversarial risk. We systematically demonstrate the advantages of our robust medical imaging AI system over the existing adversarial defense techniques under diverse real-world settings of adversarial attacks using a benchmark OCT imaging data set},

            Background context
            Traumatic thoracolumbar (TL) fractures are frequently encountered in emergency rooms. Sagittal and anteroposterior radiographs are the first step in the trauma routine imaging. Up to 30\% of TL fractures are missed in this imaging modality, thus requiring a CT and/or MRI to confirm the diagnosis. A delay in treatment leads to increased morbidity, mortality, exposure to ionizing radiation and financial burden. Fracture detection with Machine Learning models has achieved expert level performance in previous studies. Reliably detecting vertebral fractures in simple radiographic projections would have a significant clinical and financial impact.
          
          
            Purpose
            To develop a deep learning model that detects traumatic fractures on sagittal radiographs of the TL spine.
          
          
            Study design/setting
            Retrospective Cohort study.
          
          
            Methods
            We collected sagittal radiographs, CT and MRI scans of the TL spine of 362 patients exhibiting traumatic vertebral fractures. Cases were excluded when CT and/or MRI where not available. The reference standard was set by an expert group of three spine surgeons who conjointly annotated the sagittal radiographs of 171 cases. CT and/or MRI were reviewed to confirm the presence and type of the fracture in all cases. 302 cropped vertebral images were labelled ‘fracture’ and 328 ‘no fracture’. After augmentation, this dataset was then used to train, validate, and test deep learning classifiers based on ResNet18 and VGG16 architectures. To ensure that the model’s prediction was based on the correct identification of the fracture zone, an Activation Map analysis was conducted.
          
          
            Results
            Vertebras T12 to L2 were the most frequently involved, accounting for 48\% of the fractures. A4, A3 and A1 were the most frequent AO Spine fracture types. Accuracies of 88\% and 84\% were obtained with ResNet18 and VGG16 respectively. The sensitivity was 89\% with both architectures but ResNet18 showed a higher specificity (88\%) compared to VGG16 (79\%). The fracture zone was precisely identified in 81\% of the heatmaps.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Our AI model can accurately identify anomalies suggestive of vertebral fractures in sagittal radiographs by precisely identifying the fracture zone within the vertebral body.
          
          
            Clinical significance
            Clinical implementation of a diagnosis aid tool specifically trained for TL fracture identification is anticipated to reduce the rate of missed vertebral fractures in emergency rooms.},

	abstract = {The accurate segmentation and identification of vertebrae presents the foundations for spine analysis including fractures, malfunctions and other visual insights. The large-scale vertebrae segmentation challenge (VerSe), organized as a competition at the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), is aimed at vertebrae segmentation and labeling. In this paper, we propose a framework that addresses the tasks of vertebrae segmentation and identification by exploiting both deep learning and classical machine learning methodologies. The proposed solution comprises two phases: a binary fully automated segmentation of the whole spine, which exploits a 3D convolutional neural network, and a semi-automated procedure that allows locating vertebrae centroids using traditional machine learning algorithms. Unlike other approaches, the proposed method comes with the added advantage of no requirement for single vertebrae-level annotations to be trained. A dataset of 214 CT scans has been extracted from VerSe’20 challenge data, for training, validating and testing the proposed approach. In addition, to evaluate the robustness of the segmentation and labeling algorithms, 12 CT scans from subjects affected by severe, moderate and mild scoliosis have been collected from a local medical clinic. On the designated test set from Verse’20 data, the binary spine segmentation stage allowed to obtain a binary Dice coefficient of 89.17\%, whilst the vertebrae identification one reached an average multi-class Dice coefficient of 90.09\%. In order to ensure the reproducibility of the algorithms hereby developed, the code has been made publicly available.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05868},
	abstract = {In this work we focus on automatic segmentation of multiple anatomical structures in (whole body) CT images. Many segmentation algorithms exist for this task. However, in most cases they suffer from 3 problems: 1. They are difficult to use (the code and data is not publicly available or difficult to use). 2. They do not generalize (often the training dataset was curated to only contain very clean images which do not reflect the image distribution found during clinical routine), 3. The algorithm can only segment one anatomical structure. For more structures several algorithms have to be used which increases the effort required to set up the system. In this work we publish a new dataset and segmentation toolkit which solves all three of these problems: In 1204 CT images we segmented 104 anatomical structures (27 organs, 59 bones, 10 muscles, 8 vessels) covering a majority of relevant classes for most use cases. We show an improved workflow for the creation of ground truth segmentations which speeds up the process by over 10x. The CT images were randomly sampled from clinical routine, thus representing a real world dataset which generalizes to clinical application. The dataset contains a wide range of different pathologies, scanners, sequences and sites. Finally, we train a segmentation algorithm on this new dataset. We call this algorithm TotalSegmentator and make it easily available as a pretrained python pip package (pip install totalsegmentator). Usage is as simple as TotalSegmentator -i ct.nii.gz -o seg and it works well for most CT images. The code is available at https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator and the dataset at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6802613.},

	abstract = {Conversational recommender systems (CRS) aim to provide high-quality recommendations through fewer multiturn conversations. However, because short conversation histories lack sufficient item information, CRSs not only struggle to make accurate recommendations but also lack diversity in the generated responses. Existing CRSs mainly alleviate these problems by introducing external information (e.g., reviews) while ignoring information inside the conversations (e.g., potential category preferences in user utterances). Besides, item introduction is a kind of external information that is more objective and contains more entities than reviews. Therefore, we propose a Multi-information Augmented Conversational Recommender (MACR), which improves the performance of recommendation and response generation by mining the underlying category preferences in users’ utterances and incorporating item introductions. Specifically, we enhance the category associations among entities by constructing a knowledge graph DBMG with category nodes, extracting and encoding the item categories that match the user preferences into the user representation. For item introductions, we extract the entities in them and fuse them into the conversation using an introduction-attentive encoder–decoder. Extensive experiments on the dataset REDIAL show that our MACR significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches. The source code will be available at https://github.com/zcy-cqut/MACR.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems exploit interaction history to estimate user preference, having been heavily used in a wide range of industry applications. However, static recommendation models are difficult to answer two important questions well due to inherent shortcomings: (a) What exactly does a user like? (b) Why does a user like an item? The shortcomings are due to the way that static models learn user preference, i.e., without explicit instructions and active feedback from users. The recent rise of conversational recommender systems (CRSs) changes this situation fundamentally. In a CRS, users and the system can dynamically communicate through natural language interactions, which provide unprecedented opportunities to explicitly obtain the exact preference of users. Considerable efforts, spread across disparate settings and applications, have been put into developing CRSs. Existing models, technologies, and evaluation methods for CRSs are far from mature. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of the techniques used in current CRSs. We summarize the key challenges of developing CRSs in five directions: (1) Question-based user preference elicitation. (2) Multi-turn conversational recommendation strategies. (3) Dialogue understanding and generation. (4) Exploitation-exploration trade-offs. (5) Evaluation and user simulation. These research directions involve multiple research fields like information retrieval (IR), natural language processing (NLP), and human-computer interaction (HCI). Based on these research directions, we discuss some future challenges and opportunities. We provide a road map for researchers from multiple com­ munities to get started in this area. We hope this survey can help to identify and address challenges in CRSs and inspire future research.},

Based on multiple case studies on leading providers of conversational agents, this research demonstrates the complexities of the process. Our findings reveal significant differences in informational, strategic, transactional, and transformational dimensions of valuein-use of conversational agents (CA) from other technologies.

In conversational recommendation approaches, the system acquires needs and preferences in an interactive, multi-turn dialog. This is usually driven by incrementally asking users about their preferences about item features or individual items. A central research goal in this context is efﬁciency, evaluated concerning the number of required interactions until a satisfying item is found. Today, research on dialog efﬁciency is almost entirely empirical, aiming to demonstrate, for example, that one strategy for selecting questions to ask the user is better than another one in a given application. This work complements empirical research with a theoretical, domain-independent model of conversational recommendation. This model, designed to cover a range of application scenarios, allows us to investigate the efﬁciency of conversational approaches in a formal way, particularly concerning the computational complexity of devising optimal interaction strategies. An experimental evaluation empirically conﬁrms our ﬁndings.},

With the framework of dual modes of information-processing models, we hypothesized that the personalization of messages would be a central route with a greater impact on attitude for products with high involvement. By contrast, the social role of the conversational agent was expected to represent a peripheral route with a greater impact on products with low involvement. An experimental study was designed to test the effects of personalized content that reflected individual preferences for product attributes and a friend role of a voice agent with high and low product involvement. The results showed main effects of both personalization and the social role on building attitudes toward the product. Although no interaction effect for personalization and involvement was found, there was a significant interaction effect for the social role and involvement. This study contributes to persuasion theory by extending it to the interaction with a conversational agent. For practitioners, the study provides insights into the importance of the personalized content of recommendations and the need for consideration of an alternative social role in the design of voice shopping through a conversational agent.},

	abstract = {Healthcare systems across the world are transitioning into patient-centered healthcare models to ensure improved health outcomes, increased operational efficiencies and respectful patient engagement. Digital health technologies are at the forefront of this transition in facilitating a role for the patient in the clinical dimensions of the healthcare trajectory, from diagnosis and interventions to treatment and recovery. Despite this prevalence in the clinical space, the non-clinical needs of patient mental health and wellbeing are frequently overlooked by contemporary patient-centered healthcare models. Conversational agents (or chatbots) are digital dialogue systems that are widespread and widely used in sequential information provision and information acquisition tasks. Given the intimate nature of this human-machine interaction, conversational agents can be effectively utilized to support and sustain patient mental health and wellbeing. In this paper, we propose an empathic conversational agent framework based on an ensemble of natural language processing techniques and artificial intelligence algorithms for real-time monitoring and co-facilitation of patient-centered healthcare for improved mental health and wellbeing outcomes. The technical contributions of this framework are; detection of patient emotions, prediction of patient emotion transitions, detection of group emotions, formulation of patient behavioral metrics, and resource recommendations based on patient concerns. The architectural contributions of the framework are intelligent communication channels that stream empathic conversational elements and resource recommendations for the multi-user conversations and co-facilitation updates for the human healthcare provider interface. The framework was empirically evaluated on a benchmark dataset and further validated based on a clinical protocol designed for its application in an online support group setting for cancer patients and caregivers in Canada. The results of these experiments confirm the effectiveness of this framework, its contributory role and practical value in realizing a patient-centered healthcare model for improved mental health and wellbeing outcomes.},

	abstract = {Objective: This randomized controlled trial evaluates the feasibility of using an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) to teach lifestyle modiﬁcations to urban women.
Methods: Women were randomized to either 1) an ECA (content included: mindfulness, stress management, physical activity, and healthy eating) or 2) patient education sheets mirroring same content plus a meditation CD/MP3 once a day for one month. General outcome measures included: number of stress management techniques used, physical activity levels, and eating patterns.
Results: Sixty-one women ages 18 to 50 were enrolled. On average, 51\% identiﬁed as white, 26\% as black, 23\% as other races; and 20\% as Hispanic. The major stress management techniques reported at baseline were: exercise (69\%), listening to music (70\%), and social support (66\%). After one month, women randomized to the ECA signiﬁcantly decreased alcohol consumption to reduce stress (p = 0.03) and increased daily fruit consumption by an average of 2 servings compared to the control (p = 0.04).
Conclusion: It is feasible to use an ECA to promote health behaviors on stress management and healthy eating among diverse urban women. Practice implications: Compared to patient information sheets, ECAs provide promise as a way to teach healthy lifestyle behaviors to diverse urban women.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems aim to estimate item ratings and recommend items based on the users’ interests. The traditional recommender systems generally consider user–item rating information for rating prediction, but they suffer from various limitations, such as data sparsity, black-box recommendation, and cold-start problems. As a result, researchers have proposed amalgamating contextual information with rating data to provide effective recommendations. Although user-generated data in the form of reviews are a rich source of contextual information, they are rarely utilized in recommender algorithms. This study presents a hybrid recommendation technique, called RecTE, using rating data and topic embedding, which is an amalgamation of word embedding and topic modeling techniques. The novelty of RecTE lies in predicting item ratings using topic embeddings learned by incorporating local and global contextual information and integrating them with user-based collaborative filtering. RecTE is empirically evaluated over three real-world datasets – YelpNYC, YelpZip and TripAdvisor. This technique performs significantly better in comparison to nine baselines and five state-of-the-art recommendation techniques. On empirical analysis, we found that incorporating topic embedding in RecTE makes it capable of performing significantly better and handle cold-start problems effectively in comparison to the existing recommendation approaches.},

The current recommendation methods cannot guarantee the effectiveness and accuracy of course recommendation, especially when a user has enrolled in many different courses. Because these methods fail to distinguish the most relevant historical courses, which can contribute to predicting the target course that indeed reflects the user’s interests from her sequential learning behaviors. In this paper, we propose a context-aware reinforcement learning method, named Hierarchical and Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (HRRL), to efficiently reconstruct user profiles for course recommendation. The key ingredient of our scheme is the novel interaction between an attention-based recommendation model and a profile reviser with Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (RRL) that exploits temporal context. To this aim, a contextual policy gradient with approximation is proposed for RRL. By employing RRL in hierarchical tasks of revising user profiles, the proposed HRRL model enables reliable convergence in revising policy learning and improves the recommendation accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method by experiments on two open online courses datasets. Empirical results show that HRRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

	abstract = {Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are dedicated to providing learners with large-scale and open-access boutique courses. Recently, the course recommendation algorithm in MOOCs has attracted many researchers’ attention. Compared with ordinary recommendation scenarios, course interaction density in MOOCs is more tenuous, since it demands lots of time and gumption of learners. Meanwhile, the connections and semantic information among courses are much more diversiform and plentiful. Therefore, knowledge graph enhanced recommendation algorithms are appropriate for addressing the course recommendation problem in MOOCs scenario. According to relevant research on KG-based algorithms, utilization efficiency of edge information seems to be the key to boosting model effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a high-performance course recommendation model named Knowledge Grouping Aggregation Network (KGAN), which uses the course graph (a heterogeneous graph for describing the relations between courses and facts) to estimate learners’ potential interests automatically and iteratively. More precisely, KGAN constructs an end-to-end recommendation model, which projects the learner’s behavior and course graph into a unified space naturally, which alleviates difficulties in course recommendation such as interaction tenuous, course relevance, and intention diversity. In addition, we proposed intra-group and inter-group attention operator, which packages the propagation set according to the relation-links and obtains the corresponding attention priorities of different entities under different paths for constructing a reasonable and explicit encoding of users. We apply the proposed model on the real-world datasets, and the empirical results demonstrate that KGAN outperforms compelling state-of-the-art baselines. Our implementations are available at https://github.com/StZHY/KGAN.},

To address these issues, we propose a Self-Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SSRL) framework combined with dual-reward for knowledgeaware recommendation reasoning over knowledge graphs. Then, we improve Actor-Critic algorithm by using a dual-reward driven strategy, which combines short-term reward with long-term incremental evaluation. The improved algorithm helps the policy guide path reasoning in an overall situation. In addition, to ﬁnd the most potential paths, in the improved Actor-Critic algorithm, a loss constraint of each sample is used as a reinforced signal to update the gradients. With some improvements against baselines, experimental results demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our framework.},

By this mechanism, the system is able to imitate natural conversation between customer and professional sales support, for eliciting customer preference. However, many customers are not familiar with the technical features of multifunction and multi-feature products. A more natural way to explore customer preferences is by asking what they want to use with the product they are looking for (product functional requirements). Therefore, this paper proposes a computational model incorporating product functional requirements for interaction. The proposed model covers ontology and its structure as well as algorithms for generating interaction that comprises asking question, recommending products and presenting explanation of why a product is recommended. Based on our user studies, both expert users (familiar with product technical features) and novice users (not familiar with product technical feature) prefer our proposed interaction model than that of the flat interaction model (interaction model based on technical features). Meanwhile, functional requirements-based explanation is able to improve user trust in recommended products by 30\% for novice users and 17\% for expert users.},

As a result, the article provides the answers of three general, three focused, and two statistical questions to address the role of artificial intelligence in conversational agents applied to business domains. In this regard, the results show that no study combines self-learning, personalization, and generative-based responses for the same business solution. Additionally, the article describes the organization of the state-of-the-art, highlighting the correlation of business perspectives and machine learning methods.

Using real-time motion capture and content coding of recordings as well as self-reports, several data sources were considered: hand velocity as an indicator of gesturing, observed levels of engagement and remembered conversational content. Gesturing, in contrast to other indicators of engagement, was reduced under high mobility constraints and was more pronounced under low constraints. Gesturing was further positively related to observed engagement. Additionally, lower constraints resulted in more memories of conversational content. These ﬁndings emphasise the relevance of mobility constraints and bodily movement during mediated interaction and call for further model development in computer-mediated communication. Potential for application lies in interactive scenarios such as remote interviewing, testimonials, and relationship maintenance.},

Generally, these papers argue that since reviews ‘explain’ users’ opinions, they ought to be useful to infer the underlying dimensions that predict ratings or purchases. Schemes to incorporate reviews range from simple regularizers to neural network approaches. Our initial findings reveal several discrepancies in reported results, partly due to (e.g.) copying results across papers despite changes in experimental settings or data pre-processing. First, we attempt a comprehensive analysis to resolve these ambiguities. Further investigation calls for discussion on a much larger problem about the “importance" of user reviews for recommendation. Through a wide range of experiments, we observe several cases where state-of-the-art methods fail to outperform existing baselines, especially as we deviate from a few narrowly-defined settings where reviews are useful. We conclude by providing hypotheses for our observations, that seek to characterize under what conditions reviews are likely to be helpful. Through this work, we aim to evaluate the direction in which the field is progressing and encourage robust empirical evaluation.},

	abstract = {We address an important problem in sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) learning referred to as copying, in which certain segments in the input sequence are selectively replicated in the output sequence. A similar phenomenon is observable in human language communication. For example, humans tend to repeat entity names or even long phrases in conversation. The challenge with regard to copying in Seq2Seq is that new machinery is needed to decide when to perform the operation. In this paper, we incorporate copying into neural networkbased Seq2Seq learning and propose a new model called COPYNET with encoderdecoder structure. COPYNET can nicely integrate the regular way of word generation in the decoder with the new copying mechanism which can choose subsequences in the input sequence and put them at proper places in the output sequence. Our empirical study on both synthetic data sets and real world data sets demonstrates the efﬁcacy of COPYNET. For example, COPYNET can outperform regular RNN-based model with remarkable margins on text summarization tasks.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we focus on the problem of building assistive systems that can help users to write reviews. We cast this problem using an encoder-decoder framework that generates personalized reviews by expanding short phrases (e.g. review summaries, product titles) provided as input to the system. We incorporate aspect-level information via an aspect encoder that learns ‘aspect-aware’ user and item representations. An attention fusion layer is applied to control generation by attending on the outputs of multiple encoders. Experimental results show that our model is capable of generating coherent and diverse reviews that expand the contents of input phrases. In addition, the learned aspectaware representations discover those aspects that users are more inclined to discuss and bias the generated text toward their personalized aspect preferences.},

	abstract = {Neural generative models have become popular and achieved promising performance on short-text conversation tasks. They are generally trained to build a 1-to-1 mapping from the input post to its output response. However, a given post is often associated with multiple replies simultaneously in real applications. Previous research on this task mainly focuses on improving the relevance and informativeness of the top one generated response for each post. Very few works study generating multiple accurate and diverse responses for the same post. In this paper, we propose a novel response generation model, which considers a set of responses jointly and generates multiple diverse responses simultaneously. A reinforcement learning algorithm is designed to solve our model. Experiments on two short-text conversation tasks validate that the multiple responses generated by our model obtain higher quality and larger diversity compared with various state-ofthe-art generative models.},

This is due to the limitations of likelihoodbased decoding objectives in generation tasks with diverse outputs, such as conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach for incorporating side information in the form of distributional constraints over the generated responses. We propose two constraints that help generate more content rich responses that are based on a model of syntax and topics (Grifﬁths et al., 2005) and semantic similarity (Arora et al., 2016). We evaluate our approach against a variety of competitive baselines, using both automatic metrics and human judgments, showing that our proposed approach generates responses that are much less generic without sacriﬁcing plausibility.

	abstract = {Recently, some E-commerce sites launch a new interaction box called Tips on their mobile apps. Users can express their experience and feelings or provide suggestions using short texts typically several words or one sentence. In essence, writing some tips and giving a numerical rating are two facets of a user’s product assessment action, expressing the user experience and feelings. Jointly modeling these two facets is helpful for designing a better recommendation system. While some existing models integrate text information such as item specifications or user reviews into user and item latent factors for improving the rating prediction, no existing works consider tips for improving recommendation quality. We propose a deep learning based framework named NRT which can simultaneously predict precise ratings and generate abstractive tips with good linguistic quality simulating user experience and feelings. For abstractive tips generation, gated recurrent neural networks are employed to “translate” user and item latent representations into a concise sentence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets from different domains show that NRT achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the generated tips can vividly predict the user experience and feelings.},

	abstract = {A large amount of information exists in reviews written by users. This source of information has been ignored by most of the current recommender systems while it can potentially alleviate the sparsity problem and improve the quality of recommendations. In this paper, we present a deep model to learn item properties and user behaviors jointly from review text. The proposed model, named Deep Cooperative Neural Networks (DeepCoNN), consists of two parallel neural networks coupled in the last layers. One of the networks focuses on learning user behaviors exploiting reviews written by the user, and the other one learns item properties from the reviews written for the item. A shared layer is introduced on the top to couple these two networks together. The shared layer enables latent factors learned for users and items to interact with each other in a manner similar to factorization machine techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepCoNN signiﬁcantly outperforms all baseline recommender systems on a variety of datasets.},

In this work, we develop a multi-task learning solution for explainable recommendation. Two companion learning tasks of user preference modeling for recommendation and opinionated content modeling for explanation are integrated via a joint tensor factorization. As a result, the algorithm predicts not only a user’s preference over a list of items, i.e., recommendation, but also how the user would appreciate a particular item at the feature level, i.e., opinionated textual explanation. Extensive experiments on two large collections of Amazon and Yelp reviews confirmed the effectiveness of our solution in both recommendation and explanation tasks, compared with several existing recommendation algorithms. And our extensive user study clearly demonstrates the practical value of the explainable recommendations generated by our algorithm.},

Specifically, we build regression trees on users and items respectively with usergenerated reviews, and associate a latent profile to each node on the trees to represent users and items. With the growth of regression tree, the latent factors are gradually refined under the regularization imposed by the tree structure. As a result, we are able to track the creation of latent profiles by looking into the path of each factor on regression trees, which thus serves as an explanation for the resulting recommendations. Extensive experiments on two large collections of Amazon and Yelp reviews demonstrate the advantage of our model over several competitive baseline algorithms.

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

Unlike most existing approaches that only focus on leveraging knowledge graphs for more accurate recommendation, we perform explicit reasoning with knowledge for decision making so that the recommendations are generated and supported by an interpretable causal inference procedure. To this end, we propose a method called Policy-Guided Path Reasoning (PGPR), which couples recommendation and interpretability by providing actual paths in a knowledge graph. Our contributions include four aspects. We first highlight the significance of incorporating knowledge graphs into recommendation to formally define and interpret the reasoning process. Second, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach featuring an innovative soft reward strategy, user-conditional action pruning and a multi-hop scoring function. Third, we design a policy-guided graph search algorithm to efficiently and effectively sample reasoning paths for recommendation. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method on several large-scale real-world benchmark datasets, obtaining favorable results compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

However, little work has investigated these issues so far. In this paper, we first contribute with two hierarchical taxonomies for classifying user intents and recommender actions respectively based on grounded theory. We then define various categories of feature considering content, discourse, sentiment, and context to predict users’ intents and satisfaction by comparing different machine learning methods. The experimental results for user intent prediction task show that some models (such as XGBoost and SVM) can perform well in predicting user intents, and incorporating context features into the prediction model can significantly boost the performance. Our empirical study also demonstrates that leveraging dialogue behavior features (i.e., including both user intents and recommender actions) can achieve good results in predicting user satisfaction.},

	abstract = {Learning feature interactions is crucial for click-through rate (CTR) prediction in recommender systems. In most existing deep learning models, feature interactions are either manually designed or simply enumerated. However, enumerating all feature interactions brings large memory and computation cost. Even worse, useless interactions may introduce noise and complicate the training process. In this work, we propose a two-stage algorithm called Automatic Feature Interaction Selection (AutoFIS). AutoFIS can automatically identify important feature interactions for factorization models with computational cost just equivalent to training the target model to convergence. In the {\textbackslash}emph\{search stage\}, instead of searching over a discrete set of candidate feature interactions, we relax the choices to be continuous by introducing the architecture parameters. By implementing a regularized optimizer over the architecture parameters, the model can automatically identify and remove the redundant feature interactions during the training process of the model. In the {\textbackslash}emph\{re-train stage\}, we keep the architecture parameters serving as an attention unit to further boost the performance. Offline experiments on three large-scale datasets (two public benchmarks, one private) demonstrate that AutoFIS can significantly improve various FM based models. AutoFIS has been deployed onto the training platform of Huawei App Store recommendation service, where a 10-day online A/B test demonstrated that AutoFIS improved the DeepFM model by 20.3{\textbackslash}\% and 20.1{\textbackslash}\% in terms of CTR and CVR respectively.},

	abstract = {The chit-chat-based conversational recommendation systems (CRS) provide item recommendations to users through natural language interactions. To better understand user’s intentions, external knowledge graphs (KG) have been introduced into chit-chat-based CRS. However, existing chit-chat-based CRS usually generate repetitive item recommendations, and they cannot properly infuse knowledge from KG into CRS to generate informative responses. To remedy these issues, we first reformulate the conversational recommendation task to highlight that the recommended items should be new and possibly interested by users. Then, we propose the KnowledgeEnriched Conversational Recommendation System (KECRS). Specifically, we develop the Bag-of-Entity (BOE) loss and the infusion loss to better integrate KG with CRS for generating more diverse and informative responses. BOE loss provides an additional supervision signal to guide CRS to learn from both human-written utterances and KG. Infusion loss bridges the gap between the word embeddings and entity embeddings by minimizing distances of the same words in these two embeddings. Moreover, we facilitate our study by constructing a high-quality KG, i.e., The Movie Domain Knowledge Graph (TMDKG). Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that KECRS outperforms state-of-the-art chitchat-based CRS, in terms of both recommendation accuracy and response generation quality.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02342},
	abstract = {Both reviews and user-item interactions (i.e., rating scores) have been widely adopted for user rating prediction. However, these existing techniques mainly extract the latent representations for users and items in an independent and static manner. That is, a single static feature vector is derived to encode her preference without considering the particular characteristics of each candidate item. We argue that this static encoding scheme is difﬁcult to fully capture the users’ preference. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware user-item representation learning model for rating prediction, named CARL. Namely, CARL derives a joint representation for a given user-item pair based on their individual latent features and latent feature interactions. Then, CARL adopts Factorization Machines to further model higher-order feature interactions on the basis of the user-item pair for rating prediction. Speciﬁcally, two separate learning components are devised in CARL to exploit review data and interaction data respectively: review-based feature learning and interaction-based feature learning. In review-based learning component, with convolution operations and attention mechanism, the relevant features for a user-item pair are extracted by jointly considering their corresponding reviews. However, these features are only reivew-driven and may not be comprehensive. Hence, interaction-based learning component further extracts complementary features from interaction data alone, also on the basis of user-item pairs. The ﬁnal rating score is then derived with a dynamic linear fusion mechanism. Experiments on ﬁve real-world datasets show that CARL achieves signiﬁcantly better rating predication accuracy than existing state-of-the-art alternatives. Also, with attention mechanism, we show that the relevant information in reviews can be highlighted to interpret the rating prediction.},

Nevertheless, research in the field is still limited, compared to traditional recommender systems. In this work, we propose a novel Question-based recommendation method, Qrec, to assist users to find items interactively, by answering automatically constructed and algorithmically chosen questions. Previous conversational recommender systems ask users to express their preferences over items or item facets. Our model, instead, asks users to express their preferences over descriptive item features. The model is first trained offline by a novel matrix factorization algorithm, and then iteratively updates the user and item latent factors online by a closed-form solution based on the user answers. Meanwhile, our model infers the underlying user belief and preferences over items to learn an optimal question-asking strategy by using Generalized Binary Search, so as to ask a sequence of questions to the user. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed matrix factorization model outperforms the traditional Probabilistic Matrix Factorization model. Further, our proposed Qrec model can greatly improve the performance of state-of-the-art baselines, and it is also effective in the case of cold-start user and item recommendations.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems play a crucial role in our daily lives. Feed streaming mechanism has been widely used in the recommender system, especially on the mobile Apps. The feed streaming setting provides users the interactive manner of recommendation in never-ending feeds. In such a manner, a good recommender system should pay more attention to user stickiness, which is far beyond classical instant metrics and typically measured by long-term user engagement. Directly optimizing long-term user engagement is a non-trivial problem, as the learning target is usually not available for conventional supervised learning methods. Though reinforcement learning (RL) naturally fits the problem of maximizing the long term rewards, applying RL to optimize long-term user engagement is still facing challenges: user behaviors are versatile to model, which typically consists of both instant feedback (e.g., clicks) and delayed feedback (e.g., dwell time, revisit); in addition, performing effective off-policy learning is still immature, especially when combining bootstrapping and function approximation. To address these issues, in this work, we introduce a RL framework — FeedRec to optimize the long-term user engagement. FeedRec includes two components: 1) a Q-Network which designed in hierarchical LSTM takes charge of modeling complex user behaviors, and 2) a S-Network, which simulates the environment, assists the Q-Network and voids the instability of convergence in policy learning. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and a real-world large scale data show that FeedRec effectively optimizes the long-term user engagement and outperforms state-of-the-arts.},

	abstract = {Learning feature interactions is crucial for click-through rate (CTR) prediction in recommender systems. In most existing deep learning models, feature interactions are either manually designed or simply enumerated. However, enumerating all feature interactions brings large memory and computation cost. Even worse, useless interactions may introduce noise and complicate the training process. In this work, we propose a two-stage algorithm called Automatic Feature Interaction Selection (AutoFIS). AutoFIS can automatically identify important feature interactions for factorization models with computational cost just equivalent to training the target model to convergence. In the {\textbackslash}emph\{search stage\}, instead of searching over a discrete set of candidate feature interactions, we relax the choices to be continuous by introducing the architecture parameters. By implementing a regularized optimizer over the architecture parameters, the model can automatically identify and remove the redundant feature interactions during the training process of the model. In the {\textbackslash}emph\{re-train stage\}, we keep the architecture parameters serving as an attention unit to further boost the performance. Offline experiments on three large-scale datasets (two public benchmarks, one private) demonstrate that AutoFIS can significantly improve various FM based models. AutoFIS has been deployed onto the training platform of Huawei App Store recommendation service, where a 10-day online A/B test demonstrated that AutoFIS improved the DeepFM model by 20.3{\textbackslash}\% and 20.1{\textbackslash}\% in terms of CTR and CVR respectively.},

	abstract = {Combinatorial features are essential for the success of many commercial models. Manually crafting these features usually comes with high cost due to the variety, volume and velocity of raw data in web-scale systems. Factorization based models, which measure interactions in terms of vector product, can learn patterns of combinatorial features automatically and generalize to unseen features as well. With the great success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in various fields, recently researchers have proposed several DNN-based factorization model to learn both low- and high-order feature interactions. Despite the powerful ability of learning an arbitrary function from data, plain DNNs generate feature interactions implicitly and at the bit-wise level. In this paper, we propose a novel Compressed Interaction Network (CIN), which aims to generate feature interactions in an explicit fashion and at the vector-wise level. We show that the CIN share some functionalities with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We further combine a CIN and a classical DNN into one unified model, and named this new model eXtreme Deep Factorization Machine (xDeepFM). On one hand, the xDeepFM is able to learn certain bounded-degree feature interactions explicitly; on the other hand, it can learn arbitrary low- and high-order feature interactions implicitly. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets. Our results demonstrate that xDeepFM outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Almost half of the mapped articles present as a domain Entertainment or Product Review/Evaluation, with the collaborative filtering approach being the most common of the approaches used, and the similarity of friends as the most common of the social components considered. As an evaluation strategy, more than half of the mapped articles use offline experiments in a previously populated database to simulate user actions.

	title = {Towards {Personality}-{Aware} {Recommendation}},
	abstract = {In the last decade new ways of shopping online have increased the possibility of buying products and services more easily and faster than ever. In this new context, personality is a key determinant in the decision making of the consumer when shopping. The two main reasons are: ﬁrstly, a person’s buying choices are inﬂuenced by psychological factors like impulsiveness, and secondly, some consumers may be more susceptible to making impulse purchases than others. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of personality factors on advertisements has been largely neglected at the level of recommender systems. This work proposes a highly innovative research which uses a personality perspective to determine the unique associations among the consumer’s buying tendency and advert recommendations. As a matter of fact, the lack of a publicly available benchmark for computational advertising do not allow both the exploration of this intriguing research direction and the evaluation of state-of-the-art algorithms. We present the ADS Dataset, a publicly available benchmark for computational advertising enriched with Big-Five users’ personality factors and 1,200 personal users’ pictures. The proposed benchmark allows two main tasks: rating prediction over 300 real advertisements (i.e., Rich Media Ads, Image Ads, Text Ads) and click-through rate prediction. Moreover, this work carries out experiments, reviews various evaluation criteria used in the literature, and provides a library for each one of them within one integrated toolbox.},

	abstract = {Online advertising, one typical application of recommendation system, calls for effective and accurate recommendations of keywords. Extreme sparse and large scale data makes online advertising a challenging problem. To achieve better performance and accuracy of the recommendation, a better model with a short turnaround time is needed. In this paper, we address the problem of personalized online advertising for extreme sparse and large scale data. We develop a novel machine learning model (Similarity Powered Pairwise Amplifier Network, SPPAN for short). The complexity of this model (a.k.a. the number of parameters) grows with the amount of observed data, which makes it suitable to extremely sparse data. The training algorithm based on gradient descent makes it easy to parallelize. The similarity model combines the user neighborhood and item neighborhood ideas in collaborative filtering smartly, obtaining a cost-effective way to handle large scale data. The proposed framework is evaluated on a large set of real-world data set from a large internet company (expressed by “Company A”). The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed SPPAN model can greatly improve the prediction and recommendation accuracy on that extreme sparse data set compared with existing approaches.},

At present, most algorithms use two-valued trust relationship of social network to improve recommendation quality but fail to take into account the difference of trust intensity of each friend and user’s comment information. To this end, the recommendation system within a social network adopts topical attention and probabilistic matrix factorization (STAPMF) is proposed. We combine the trust information in social networks and the topical information from review documents by proposing a novel algorithm combining probabilistic matrix factorization and attention-based recurrent neural networks to extract item underlying feature vectors, user’s personal potential feature vectors, and user’s social hidden feature vectors, which represent the features extracted from the user’s trusted network. Using real-world datasets, we show a significant improvement in recommendation performance comparing with the prevailing state-of-the-art algorithms for social network-based recommendation.},

The company’s recommendation environment displays the following unique characteristics: First, the company’s online and ofﬂine stores sell the same products. Second, fashion products are usually seasonal, so customers’ general preference changes according to the time of year. Last, customers usually purchase items to replace previously preferred items or purchase items to complement those already bought. We propose a new system called K-RecSys, which extends the typical item-based collaborative ﬁltering algorithm by reﬂecting the above domain characteristics. K-RecSys combines online product click data and ofﬂine product sale data weighted to reﬂect the online and ofﬂine preferences of customers. It also adopts a preference decay function to reﬂect changes in preferences over time, and ﬁnally recommends substitute and complementary products using product category information. We conducted an A/B test in the actual operating environment to compare K-RecSys with the existing collaborative ﬁltering system implemented with only online data. Our experimental results show that the proposed system is superior in terms of product clicks and sales in the online shopping mall and its substitute recommendations are adopted more frequently than complementary recommendations.},

This is especially relevant for outfit recommendation, since a variety of fashion product features play a role in creating outfits. This work is a comparative study of fusion methods for outfit recommendation that combine relevant product features extracted from visual and textual data in semantic, multimodal item representations. We compare traditional fusion methods with attention-based fusion methods, which are designed to focus on the fine-grained product features of items. We evaluate the fusion methods on four benchmark datasets for outfit recommendation and provide insights into the importance of the multimodality and granularity of the fashion item representations. We find that the visual and textual item data not only share product features but also contain complementary product features for the outfit recommendation task, confirming the need to effectively combine them into multimodal item representations. Furthermore, we show that the average performance of attention-based fusion methods surpasses the average performance of traditional fusion methods on three out of the four benchmark datasets, demonstrating the ability of attention to learn relevant correlations among fine-grained fashion attributes.},

Fashion style recognition deals with the problem of assigning a person’s outﬁt to a fashion style category. Due to the high similarity between different clothing items and the use of softmax-based loss functions, many of the current methods that address this problem show relatively poor performance and cannot guarantee sufﬁcient 15 inter-class margins in the fashion domain. In this work, we propose an end-to-end method for deep visual recognition by combining a standard CNN architecture with a novel loss function, which we call Additive Cosine Margin Loss (ACML). The proposed function not only projects feature vectors of different classes into different regions of the embedding, but also enforces compactness of the projections within each 20 class. Our experiments were conducted on two public and well-known fashion style recognition datasets FashionStyle14 and HipsterWars, and on the face veriﬁcation and identiﬁcation datasets LFW, YTF, and MegaFace. These experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed loss function over: 1) existing angular margin-based loss functions 2) state-of-the-art methods for clothing style recognition as well as face anal25 ysis tasks.},

Our model facilitates two kinds of fashion recommendation, namely, similar product and mix-and-match, by leveraging text-based product attributes and image features. To suggest similar products, we construct a new similarity measure to compare the image colour and texture descriptors. For mix-and-match recommendation, we ﬁrstly adopt convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify ﬁne-grained clothing categories and ﬁne-grained clothing attributes from product images. Algorithm is developed to make mix-and-match recommendations by integrating the image extracted categories and attributes information are with text-based product attributes.

Fashion outfit matching has become an essential component to users while shopping, which helps users to select and present items to individuals in a personalized fashion recommendation. Apparently, it is an arduous task to guide complementary clothing matching due to the complexity and subjectivity of fashion items. Some existing solutions have been presented in recent years, which are tending to discover a series of visual cues to establish the matching relations. However, it would be mismatched easily due to these methods being hard to represent all the potential semantic information from the appearance of clothes. To thoroughly make use of the visual characteristics of clothing products and the related description information, we propose a complementary clothing matching method with some compatibility knowledge, named it CCMCK shortly. For visual compatibility, we adopt the graph neural network to model the visual relationship between items. To generate an outfit that satisfies the requirement of fashion compatibility, we propose a matching way under the compatibility constraint and seek to recommend compatible items based on multi-modal compatibility. Finally, we performed a qualitative investigation on the fill-in-the-blank and fashion outfit compatibility tasks to evaluate the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Online stylist service enjoys huge economic potentials due to the trend of transformation of the fashion industry to digitalisation. Existing works either predict the fashion compatibility from the overall aspect or evaluate the compatibility with type-conditional representations. The prediction is hard to interpret due to the abstractive forecast. This paper proposes a visual and semantic representation model for explainable evaluation and recommendation. The model considers fashion compatibility from different factors, such as colour, material and style, by leveraging low to high-level features from former to later layers of CNN. The colour correlation and the pairwise relationship of fashion items in the same outfit are considered during the prediction stage. Instead of just predicting an outfit as compatible or incompatible, the model can classify an outfit as three precise evaluation levels: Good, Normal and Bad. The detailed compatible level is more consistent with the fashion sense of our human brain as Good or Bad outfits may have specific characteristics while Normal outfits tend to be ordinary. Additionally, the model can diagnose and recommend substitutions of the problematic fashion items from overall compatibility or colour-specific aspects by tracking the prediction matrices’ backpropagation gradients during the recommendation stage. Experiments in terms of outfit compatibility prediction and fill in the blank are conducted to evaluate the prediction ability of the proposed model. In contrast, fashion substitution recommendation experiments are conducted to assess the compatibility diagnosis and recommendation ability. Quantitative and qualitative results show that the model enables online stylist services with excellent explainability and generalisation on fashion prediction and recommendation.},

	abstract = {In a real-world shopping scenario, users can express their naturallanguage feedback when communicating with a shopping assistant by stating their satisfactions positively with “I like” or negatively with “I dislike” according to the quality of the recommended fashion products. A multimodal conversational recommender system (using text and images in particular) aims to replicate this process by eliciting the dynamic preferences of users from their natural-language feedback and updating the visual recommendations so as to satisfy the users’ current needs through multi-turn interactions. However, the impact of positive and negative natural-language feedback on the effectiveness of multimodal conversational recommendation has not yet been fully explored. Since there are no datasets of conversational recommendation with both positive and negative natural-language feedback, the existing research on multimodal conversational recommendation imposed several constraints on the users’ natural-language expressions (i.e. either only describing their preferred attributes as positive feedback or rejecting the undesired recommendations without any natural-language critiques) to simplify the multimodal conversational recommendation task. To further explore the multimodal conversational recommendation with positive and negative natural-language feedback, we investigate the effectiveness of the recent multimodal conversational recommendation models for effectively incorporating the users’ preferences over time from both positively and negatively natural-language oriented feedback corresponding to the visual recommendations. We also propose an approach to generate both positive and negative natural-language critiques about the recommendations within an existing user simulator. Following previous work, we train and evaluate the two existing conversational recommendation models by using the user simulator with positive and negative feedback as a surrogate for real human users. Extensive experiments conducted on a well-known fashion dataset demonstrate that positive natural-language feedback is more informative relating to the users’ preferences in comparison to negative natural-language feedback.},

            We currently observe the rapid emergence of startups that use Artificial Intelligence (AI) as part of their business model. While recent research suggests that AI startups employ novel or different business models, one could argue that AI technology has been used in business models for a long time already—questioning the novelty of those business models. Therefore, this study investigates how AI startup business models potentially differ from common IT-related business models. First, a business model taxonomy of AI startups is developed from a sample of 100 AI startups and four archetypal business model patterns are derived: AI-charged Product/Service Provider, AI Development Facilitator, Data Analytics Provider, and Deep Tech Researcher. Second, drawing on this descriptive analysis, three distinctive aspects of AI startup business models are discussed: (1) new value propositions through AI capabilities, (2) different roles of data for value creation, and (3) the impact of AI technology on the overall business logic. This study contributes to our fundamental understanding of AI startup business models by identifying their key characteristics, common instantiations, and distinctive aspects. Furthermore, this study proposes promising directions for future entrepreneurship research. For practice, the taxonomy and patterns serve as structured tools to support entrepreneurial action.},

Several reviews that focus on the use and advances of GAN in general have been proposed. However, the GAN models applied to the face, that we call facial GANs, have never been addressed. In this article, we review facial GANs and their different applications. We mainly focus on architectures, problems and performance evaluation with respect to each application and used datasets. More precisely, we reviewed the progress of architectures and we discussed the contributions and limits of each. Then, we exposed the encountered problems of facial GANs and proposed solutions to handle them. Additionally, as GANs evaluation has become a notable current defiance, we investigate the state of the art quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics and their applications. We concluded the article with a discussion on the face generation challenges and proposed open research issues.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems (RSs) have become an inseparable part of our everyday lives. They help us find our favorite items to purchase, our friends on social networks, and our favorite movies to watch. Traditionally, the recommendation problem was considered to be a classification or prediction problem, but it is now widely agreed that formulating it as a sequential decision problem can better reflect the user-system interaction. Therefore, it can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and be solved by reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Unlike traditional recommendation methods, including collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, RL is able to handle the sequential, dynamic user-system interaction and to take into account the long-term user engagement. Although the idea of using RL for recommendation is not new and has been around for about two decades, it was not very practical, mainly because of scalability problems of traditional RL algorithms. However, a new trend has emerged in the field since the introduction of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which made it possible to apply RL to the recommendation problem with large state and action spaces. In this paper, a survey on reinforcement learning based recommender systems (RLRSs) is presented. Our aim is to present an outlook on the field and to provide the reader with a fairly complete knowledge of key concepts of the field. We first recognize and illustrate that RLRSs can be generally classified into RL- and DRL-based methods. Then, we propose an RLRS framework with four components, i.e., state representation, policy optimization, reward formulation, and environment building, and survey RLRS algorithms accordingly. We highlight emerging topics and depict important trends using various graphs and tables. Finally, we discuss important aspects and challenges that can be addressed in the future.},

The underlying idea is to recommend highly predicted items that also have been found as reliable ones. We use the deep learning architecture to extract the existing non-linear relations between predictions, reliabilities, and accurate recommendations. The proposed architecture consists of three related stages, providing three stacked abstraction levels: (a) real prediction errors, (b) predicted errors (reliabilities), and (c) predicted ratings (predictions). In turn, each abstraction level requires a learning process: (a) Matrix Factorization from ratings, (b) Multilayer Neural Network fed with real prediction errors and hidden factors, and (c) Multilayer Neural Network fed with reliabilities and hidden factors. A complete set of experiments has been run involving three representative and open datasets and a state-of-the-art baseline. The results show strong prediction improvements and also important recommendation improvements, particularly for the recall quality measure.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the use of recommender systems has become popular on the web. To improve recommendation performance, usage, and scalability, the research has evolved by producing several generations of recommender systems. There is much literature about it, although most proposals focus on traditional methods’ theories and applications. Recently, knowledge graphbased recommendations have attracted attention in academia and the industry because they can alleviate information sparsity and performance problems. We found only two studies that analyze the recommendation system’s role over graphs, but they focus on speciﬁc recommendation methods. This survey attempts to cover a broader analysis from a set of selected papers. In summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) we explore traditional and more recent developments of ﬁltering methods for a recommender system, (2) we identify and analyze proposals related to knowledge graph-based recommender systems, (3) we present the most relevant contributions using an application domain, and (4) we outline future directions of research in the domain of recommender systems. As the main survey result, we found that the use of knowledge graphs for recommendations is an efﬁcient way to leverage and connect a user’s and an item’s knowledge, thus providing more precise results for users.},

	abstract = {With the spread of COVID-19, the “untact” culture in South Korea is expanding and customers are increasingly seeking for online services. A recommendation system serves as a decisionmaking indicator that helps users by suggesting items to be purchased in the future by exploring the symmetry between multiple user activity characteristics. A plethora of approaches are employed by the scientific community to design recommendation systems, including collaborative filtering, stereotyping, and content-based filtering, etc. The current paradigm of recommendation systems favors collaborative filtering due to its significant potential to closely capture the interest of a user as compared to other approaches. The collaborative filtering harnesses features like user-profile details, visited pages, and click information to determine the interest of a user, thereby recommending the items that are related to the user’s interest. The existing collaborative filtering approaches exploit implicit and explicit features and report either good classification or prediction outcome. These systems fail to exhibit good results for both measures at the same time. We believe that avoiding the recommendation of those items that have already been purchased could contribute to overcoming the said issue. In this study, we present a collaborative filtering-based algorithm to tackle big data of user with symmetric purchasing order and repetitive purchased products. The proposed algorithm relies on combining extreme gradient boosting machine learning architecture with word2vec mechanism to explore the purchased products based on the click patterns of users. Our algorithm improves the accuracy of predicting the relevant products to be recommended to the customers that are likely to be bought. The results are evaluated on the dataset that contains click-based features of users from an online shopping mall in Jeju Island, South Korea. We have evaluated Mean Absolute Error, Mean Square Error, and Root Mean Square Error for our proposed methodology and also other machine learning algorithms. Our proposed model generated the least error rate and enhanced the prediction accuracy of the recommendation system compared to other traditional approaches.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Today the recommendation technology has managed to achieve a distinct place in the modern and fascinating world of e-commerce applications as it helps the user in selecting items or products of his interest from a large pool. The present article aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic review of the state-of-the-art recommender systems. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The entire literature review process was divided into six research questions keeping in view the different perspectives of recommendation field. The methodology adopted here, consists of the search plan and the paper selection criteria. The search plan attempts to retrieve the research studies through several digital libraries and the paper selection criteria help filter out the most relevant studies further to gather evidence against each of the research questions. Findings: The literature review process provides a thorough discussion on different techniques deployed in recommender system literature such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, social filtering, demographic and knowledge-based and utility based systems. It also explores their strengths and weaknesses. The recommender systems face certain challenges in their deployment such as cold-start, sparsity, scalability, user privacy, etc. The different application domains where recommender systems are being adopted these days include movie, music, books, news, tourism etc. The gap analysis conducted during literature review, focuses on improving the traditional recommendation approaches, the precise blend of existing approaches with different types of information, modeling of user profiles and recommended items, standardization of non-standard evaluation techniques etc. Application/Improvements: This paper also throws some light on certain application fields such as television, research grants, restaurant, job search, etc. that need to grab the attention of scientific and research communities to promote more research in those areas.},

Due to its learning capabilities from data, DL technology originated from artificial neural network (ANN), has become a hot topic in the context of computing, and is widely applied in various application areas like healthcare, visual recognition, text analytics, cybersecurity, and many more. However, building an appropriate DL model is a challenging task, due to the dynamic nature and variations in real-world problems and data. Moreover, the lack of core understanding turns DL methods into black-box machines that hamper development at the standard level. This article presents a structured and comprehensive view on DL techniques including a taxonomy considering various types of real-world tasks like supervised or unsupervised. In our taxonomy, we take into account deep networks for supervised or discriminative learning, unsupervised or generative learning as well as hybrid learning and relevant others. We also summarize real-world application areas where deep learning techniques can be used. Finally, we point out ten potential aspects for future generation DL modeling with research directions. Overall, this article aims to draw a big picture on DL modeling that can be used as a reference guide for both academia and industry professionals.},

Memory-based algorithms recommend according to the preferences of nearest neighbors, and model-based algorithms recommend by ﬁrst developing a model of user ratings. In this paper, we bring to surface factors that aﬀect CF process in order to identify existing false beliefs. In terms of accuracy, by being able to view the ‘‘big picture’’, we propose new approaches that substantially improve the performance of CF algorithms. For instance, we obtain more than 40\% increase in precision in comparison to widely-used CF algorithms. In terms of eﬃciency, we propose a model-based approach based on latent semantic indexing (LSI), that reduces execution times at least 50\% than the classic CF algorithms.},

	abstract = {The problem of computing all pairwise similarities in a large collection of vectors is a well-known and common data mining task. As the number and dimensionality of these vectors keeps increasing, however, currently existing approaches are often unable to meet the strict efficiency requirements imposed by the environments they need to perform in. Real-time neighbourhood-based collaborative filtering (CF) is one example of such an environment in which performance is critical. In this work, we present a novel algorithm for efficient and exact similarity computation between sparse, high-dimensional vectors. Our approach exploits the sparsity that is inherent to implicit feedback data-streams, entailing significant gains compared to other methods. Furthermore, as our model learns incrementally, it is naturally suited for dynamic real-time CF environments. We propose a MapReduce-inspired parallellisation procedure along with our method, and show how even more speed-up can be achieved. Additionally, in many real-world systems, many items are actually not recommendable at any given time, due to recency, stock, seasonality, or enforced business rules. We exploit this fact to further improve the computational efficiency of our approach. Experimental evaluation on both real-world and publicly available datasets shows that our approach scales up to millions of processed user-item interactions per second, and well advances the state-of-the-art.},

              Background
              Interest in the application of machine learning (ML) to the design, conduct, and analysis of clinical trials has grown, but the evidence base for such applications has not been surveyed. This manuscript reviews the proceedings of a multi-stakeholder conference to discuss the current and future state of ML for clinical research. Key areas of clinical trial methodology in which ML holds particular promise and priority areas for further investigation are presented alongside a narrative review of evidence supporting the use of ML across the clinical trial spectrum.
            
            
              Results
              Conference attendees included stakeholders, such as biomedical and ML researchers, representatives from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), artificial intelligence technology and data analytics companies, non-profit organizations, patient advocacy groups, and pharmaceutical companies. ML contributions to clinical research were highlighted in the pre-trial phase, cohort selection and participant management, and data collection and analysis. A particular focus was paid to the operational and philosophical barriers to ML in clinical research. Peer-reviewed evidence was noted to be lacking in several areas.
            
            
              Conclusions
              ML holds great promise for improving the efficiency and quality of clinical research, but substantial barriers remain, the surmounting of which will require addressing significant gaps in evidence.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems are ubiquitous in the modern internet, where they help users find items they might like. A widely deployed recommendation approach is item-based collaborative filtering. This approach relies on analyzing large item cooccurrence matrices that denote how many users interacted with a pair of items. The potentially quadratic number of items to compare poses a scalability bottleneck in analyzing such item cooccurrences. Additionally, this problem intensifies in real world use cases with incrementally growing datasets, especially when the recommendation model is regularly recomputed from scratch. We highlight the connection between the growing cost of item-based recommendation and densification processes in common interaction datasets. Based on our findings, we propose an efficient incremental algorithm for itembased collaborative filtering based on cooccurrence analysis. This approach restricts the number of interactions to consider from ‘power users’ and ‘ubiquitous items’ to guarantee a provably constant amount of work per user-item interaction to process. We discuss efficient implementations of our algorithm on a single machine as well as on a distributed stream processing engine, and present an extensive experimental evaluation. Our results confirm the asymptotic benefits of the incremental approach. Furthermore, we find that our implementation is an order of magnitude faster than existing open source recommender libraries on many datasets, and at the same time scales to high dimensional datasets which these existing recommenders fail to process.},

	abstract = {We study the practical consequences of dataset sampling strategies on the ranking performance of recommendation algorithms. Recommender systems are generally trained and evaluated on samples of larger datasets. Samples are often taken in a naïve or ad-hoc fashion: e.g. by sampling a dataset randomly or by selecting users or items with many interactions. As we demonstrate, commonly-used data sampling schemes can have significant consequences on algorithm performance. Following this observation, this paper makes three main contributions: (1) characterizing the effect of sampling on algorithm performance, in terms of algorithm and dataset characteristics (e.g. sparsity characteristics, sequential dynamics, etc.); (2) designing SVP-CF, which is a data-specific sampling strategy, that aims to preserve the relative performance of models after sampling, and is especially suited to long-tailed interaction data; and (3) developing an oracle, Data-genie, which can suggest the sampling scheme that is most likely to preserve model performance for a given dataset. The main benefit of Data-genie is that it will allow recommender system practitioners to quickly prototype and compare various approaches, while remaining confident that algorithm performance will be preserved, once the algorithm is retrained and deployed on the complete data. Detailed experiments show that using Data-genie, we can discard upto 5× more data than any sampling strategy with the same level of performance.},

As is demonstrated in this paper, the technique is fast, scalable, accurate, and requires only a modest learning curve. It makes use of a hierarchical classi cation scheme in order to introduce context into the rating process, and uses so-called creative links in order to nd surprising and atypical items to recommend, perhaps even items which cross the group boundaries. The new technique is one of the key engines of the Intelligent Recommendation Algorithm  IRA  project, now being developed at IBM Research. In addition to several other recommendation engines, IRA contains a situation analyzer to determine the most appropriate mix of engines for a particular e-commerce merchant, as well as an engine for optimizing the placement of advertisements.},

Traditional similarity measures utilize ratings of only co-rated items while computing similarity between a pair of users. As a result, these measures cannot fully utilize the rating information and are not suitable for real world sparse data. To solve these issues, we propose a novel user distance measure named Preference Mover’s Distance (PMD) which makes full use of all ratings made by each user. Our proposed PMD can properly measure the distance between a pair of users even if they have no co-rated items. We show that this measure can be cast as an instance of the Earth Mover’s Distance, a wellstudied transportation problem for which several highly efficient solvers have been developed. Experimental results show that PMD can help achieve superior recommendation accuracy than state-ofthe-art methods, especially when training data is very sparse.},

In the context of Web personalization, particularly at the early stages of a visitor’s interaction with the site (i.e., before registration or authentication), recommender systems must rely on anonymous clickstream data. The lack of explicit user ratings and the shear amount of data in such a setting poses serious challenges to standard collaborative ﬁltering techniques in terms of scalability and performance. Oﬄine clustering of users transactions can be used to improve the scalability of collaborative ﬁltering, however, this is often at the cost of reduced recommendation accuracy. In this paper we study the impact of various preprocessing techniques applied to clickstream data, such as clustering, normalization, and signiﬁcance ﬁltering, on collaborative ﬁltering. Our experimental results, performed on real usage data, indicate that with proper data preparation, the clustering-based approach to collaborative ﬁltering can achieve dramatic improvements in terms of recommendation eﬀectiveness, while maintaining the computational advantage over the direct approaches such as the k-NearestNeighbor technique.},

The user-item interactions contain a sequential dependency that we need to capture to better recommend. Item-item Product (IIP), which models item co-occurrence, has shown good potential by characterizing the pairwise item relationships. Generally, recent behaviors have a greater impact on the current than long-term historical behaviors. And the decaying rate of influence around infrequent behaviors is fast. However, IIP ignores such a phenomenon when considering item-item relevance and leads to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose an attenuated IIP mechanism which is position-aware and decays the influence of historical items at an exponential rate. Besides, In order to make up for scenarios where the influence is not in a monotonous decline trend, we add another normalized IIP mechanism to complement the attenuated IIP mechanism. It also strengthen the model’s ability in discriminating favorite items under the sparse data condition by enlarging the gap of matching degree between items. Experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model achieves better performance than a set of state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models.},

	abstract = {The paper explores stability as a new measure of recommender systems performance. Stability is defined to measure the extent to which a recommendation algorithm provides predictions that are consistent with each other. Specifically, for a stable algorithm, adding some of the algorithm’s own predictions to the algorithm’s training data (for example, if these predictions were confirmed as accurate by users) would not invalidate or change the other predictions. While stability is an interesting theoretical property that can provide additional understanding about recommendation algorithms, we believe stability to be a desired practical property for recommender systems designers as well, because unstable recommendations can potentially decrease users’ trust in recommender systems and, as a result, reduce users’ acceptance of recommendations. In this paper, we also provide an extensive empirical evaluation of stability for six popular recommendation algorithms on four real-world datasets. Our results suggest that stability performance of individual recommendation algorithms is consistent across a variety of datasets and settings. In particular, we find that model-based recommendation algorithms consistently demonstrate higher stability than neighborhood-based collaborative filtering techniques. In addition, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis of many important factors (e.g., the sparsity of original rating data, normalization of input data, the number of new incoming ratings, the distribution of incoming ratings, the distribution of evaluation data, etc.) and report the impact they have on recommendation stability.

However, evaluating recommendations involves particularities that pose challenges to the assumptions upon which the ML and IR methodologies were developed. We recap and reflect on the development and current status of recommender system evaluation, providing an updated perspective. With a focus on offline evaluation, we review the adaptation of IR principles, procedures and metrics, and the implications of those techniques when applied to recommender systems. At the same time, we identify the singularities of recommendation that require different responses, or involve specific new needs. In addition, we provide an overview of important choices in the configuration of experiments that require particular care and understanding; discuss broader perspectives of evaluation such as recommendation value beyond accuracy; and survey open challenges such as experimental biases, and the cyclic dimension of recommendation.},

	abstract = {The most common way to listen to recorded music nowadays is via streaming platforms which provide access to tens of millions of tracks. To assist users in effectively browsing these large catalogs, the integration of Music Recommender Systems (MRSs) has become essential. Current real-world MRSs are often quite complex and optimized for recommendation accuracy. They combine several building blocks based on collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation. This complexity can hinder the ability to explain recommendations to end users, which is particularly important for recommendations perceived as unexpected or inappropriate. While pure recommendation performance often correlates with user satisfaction, explainability has a positive impact on other factors such as trust and forgiveness, which are ultimately essential to maintain user loyalty. In this article, we discuss how explainability can be addressed in the context of MRSs. We provide perspectives on how explainability could improve music recommendation algorithms and enhance user experience. First, we review common dimensions and goals of recommenders’ explainability and in general of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), and elaborate on the extent to which these apply – or need to be adapted – to the specific characteristics of music consumption and recommendation. Then, we show how explainability components can be integrated within a MRS and in what form explanations can be provided. Since the evaluation of explanation quality is decoupled from pure accuracy-based evaluation criteria, we also discuss requirements and strategies for evaluating explanations of music recommendations. Finally, we describe the current challenges for introducing explainability within a large-scale industrial music recommender system and provide research perspectives.},

	abstract = {Recent studies on recommendation have largely focused on exploring state-of-the-art neural networks to improve the expressiveness of models, while typically apply the Negative Sampling (NS) strategy for efﬁcient learning. Despite effectiveness, two important issues have not been well-considered in existing methods: 1) NS suffers from dramatic ﬂuctuation, making sampling-based methods difﬁcult to achieve the optimal ranking performance in practical applications; 2) although heterogeneous feedback (e.g., view, click, and purchase) is widespread in many online systems, most existing methods leverage only one primary type of user feedback such as purchase. In this work, we propose a novel nonsampling transfer learning solution, named Efﬁcient Heterogeneous Collaborative Filtering (EHCF) for Top-N recommendation. It can not only model ﬁne-grained user-item relations, but also efﬁciently learn model parameters from the whole heterogeneous data (including all unlabeled data) with a rather low time complexity. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that EHCF signiﬁcantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation methods in both traditional (single-behavior) and heterogeneous scenarios. Moreover, EHCF shows signiﬁcant improvements in training efﬁciency, making it more applicable to real-world large-scale systems. Our implementation has been released 1 to facilitate further developments on efﬁcient whole-data based neural methods.},

	abstract = {The ACM Recommender Systems Challenge 2018 focused on the task of automatic music playlist continuation, which is a form of the more general task of sequential recommendation. Given a playlist of arbitrary length with some additional meta-data, the task was to recommend up to 500 tracks that fit the target characteristics of the original playlist. For the RecSys Challenge, Spotify released a dataset of one million user-generated playlists. Participants could compete in two tracks, i.e., main and creative tracks. Participants in the main track were only allowed to use the provided training set, however, in the creative track, the use of external public sources was permitted. In total, 113 teams submitted 1,228 runs to the main track; 33 teams submitted 239 runs to the creative track. The highest performing team in the main track achieved an R-precision of 0.2241, an NDCG of 0.3946, and an average number of recommended songs clicks of 1.784. In the creative track, an R-precision of 0.2233, an NDCG of 0.3939, and a click rate of 1.785 was obtained by the best team. This article provides an overview of the challenge, including motivation, task definition, dataset description, and evaluation. We further report and analyze the results obtained by the top performing teams in each track and explore the approaches taken by the winners. We finally summarize our key findings, discuss generalizability of approaches and results to domains other than music, and list the open avenues and possible future directions in the area of automatic playlist continuation.},

Collaborative filtering is a widely used mechanism to predict a particular user’s interest in a given item, based on feedback from neighbour users with similar tastes. The way the user’s neighbourhood is identified has a significant impact on prediction accuracy. Most methods estimate user proximity from ratings they assigned to co-rated items, regardless of their number. This paper introduces a similarity adjustment taking into account the number of co-ratings. The proposed method is based on a concordance ratio representing the probability that two users share the same taste for a new item. The probabilities are further adjusted by using the Empirical Bayes inference method before being used to weight similarities. The proposed approach improves existing similarity measures without increasing time complexity and the adjustment can be combined with all existing similarity measures. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets confirmed that the proposed method systematically improved the recommender system’s prediction accuracy performance for all considered similarity measures.},

With countless papers being published on the topic each year, one might think the recommendation problem is almost solved.

The effect of this subsampling on the computing time and accuracy of CF is not fully understood, and clear guidelines for selecting optimal or even appropriate subsampling levels are not available. In this paper, we present a Density-based Random Stratiﬁed Subsampling using Clustering (DRSC) algorithm in which the desired Fraction of Users Dropped (FUD) and Fraction of Items Dropped (FID) are speciﬁed, and the overall density during subsampling is maintained. Subsequently, we develop simple models of the Training Time Improvement (TTI) and the Accuracy Loss (AL) as functions of FUD and FID, based on extensive simulations of seven standard CF algorithms as applied to various primary matrices from MovieLens, Yahoo Music Rating, and Amazon Automotive data. Simulations show that both TTI and a scaled AL are bi-linear in FID and FUD for all seven methods. The TTI linear regression of a CF method appears to be same for all datasets. Extensive simulations illustrate that TTI can be estimated reliably with FUD and FID only, but AL requires considering additional dataset characteristics. The derived models are then used to optimize the levels of subsampling addressing the tradeoff between TTI and AL. A simple sub-optimal approximation was found, in which the optimal AL is proportional to the optimal Training Time Reduction Factor (TTRF) for higher values of TTRF, and the optimal subsampling levels, like optimal FID/(1–FID), are proportional to the square root of TTRF.},

Furthermore, theoretical insights gained from the analysis of this model-based method suggested a way to incorporate aggregate information into the heuristic itembased CF method. Both the model-based and the heuristic item-based CF methods were empirically tested on several datasets, and the experiments uniformly conﬁrmed that the aggregate rating information indeed improves CF recommendations. These results also show the power of theory by demonstrating how the insights gained from theoretical developments can shed light on proper selection of good heuristic methods. We also showed the way to introduce scalability and parallelization into the estimation procedure and reported the running time for steps of the estimation procedure for large datasets.},

Three algorithms are introduced to reduce the candidates shingles to be compared: one creates the relation of shingles to be considered, the second one creates the set of triples and the third one gives the similarity of documents by efficiently counting the shared shingles between documents. The experiment results show that our method reduces the number of candidates pairs to be compared from which reduce also the execution time and space compared with existing algorithms which consider the computation of all pairs candidates.},

	abstract = {Sequential Recommendation characterizes the evolving patterns by modeling item sequences chronologically. The essential target of it is to capture the item transition correlations. The recent developments of transformer inspire the community to design effective sequence encoders, e.g., SASRec and BERT4Rec. However, we observe that these transformer-based models suffer from the cold-start issue, i.e., performing poorly for short sequences. Therefore, we propose to augment short sequences while still preserving original sequential correlations. We introduce a new framework for Augmenting Sequential Recommendation with Pseudo-prior items (ASReP). We firstly pre-train a transformer with sequences in a reverse direction to predict prior items. Then, we use this transformer to generate fabricated historical items at the beginning of short sequences. Finally, we fine-tune the transformer using these augmented sequences from the time order to predict the next item. Experiments on two real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of ASReP. The code is available on https://github.com/DyGRec/ASReP.},

Three MapReduce algorithms are introduced: one based on brute force, a second where the problem is treated as large-scale ad hoc retrieval, and a third based on the Cartesian product of postings lists. Each algorithm supports one or more approximations that trade eﬀectiveness for eﬃciency, the characteristics of which are studied experimentally. Results show that the brute force algorithm is the most eﬃcient of the three when exact similarity is desired. However, the other two algorithms support approximations that yield large efﬁciency gains without signiﬁcant loss of eﬀectiveness.},

MF models decompose the observed user-item interaction matrix into user and item latent factors. In this paper, we propose a cofactorization model, CoFactor, which jointly decomposes the user-item interaction matrix and the item-item co-occurrence matrix with shared item latent factors. For each pair of items, the co-occurrence matrix encodes the number of users that have consumed both items. CoFactor is inspired by the recent success of word embedding models (e.g., word2vec) which can be interpreted as factorizing the word co-occurrence matrix. We show that this model signiﬁcantly improves the performance over MF models on several datasets with little additional computational overhead. We provide qualitative results that explain how CoFactor improves the quality of the inferred factors and characterize the circumstances where it provides the most signiﬁcant improvements.},

	abstract = {Inverted indexes are the most fundamental and widely used data structures in information retrieval. For each unique word occurring in a document collection, the inverted index stores a list of the documents in which this word occurs. Compression techniques are often applied to further reduce the space requirement of these lists. However, the index has a shortcoming, in that only predeﬁned pattern queries can be supported eﬃciently. In terms of string documents where word boundaries are undeﬁned, if we have to index all the substrings of a given document, then the storage quickly becomes quadratic in the data size. Also, if we want to apply the same type of indexes for querying phrases or sequence of words, then the inverted index will end up storing redundant information. In this paper, we show the ﬁrst set of inverted indexes which work naturally for strings as well as phrase searching. The central idea is to exclude document d in the inverted list of a string P if every occurrence of P in d is subsumed by another string of which P is a preﬁx. With this we show that our space utilization is close to the optimal. Techniques from succinct data structures are deployed to achieve compression while allowing fast access in terms of frequency and document id based retrieval. Compression and speed tradeoﬀs are evaluated for diﬀerent variants of the proposed index. For phrase searching, we show that our indexes compare favorably against a typical inverted index deploying position-wise intersections. We also show eﬃcient top-k based retrieval under relevance metrics like frequency and tf-idf.},

Spearman’s Footrule distance is used to compute the similarity between rankings, considering how well rankings agree on the positions (ranks) of ranked items (i.e., the L1 distance). This setup allows the application of metric index structures such as M- or BK-trees and, alternatively, enables the use of traditional inverted indices for retrieving rankings that overlap (in items) with the query. Although both techniques are reasonable, they come with individual drawbacks for our speciﬁc problem. In this paper, we propose a hybrid indexing strategy, which blends inverted indices and metric space indexing, resulting in a structure that resembles both indexing methods with tunable emphasis on one or the other. To ﬁnd the sweet spot, we propose an assumption-lean but highly accurate (empirically validated) cost model through theoretical analysis. We further present optimizations to the inverted index component, for early termination and minimizing bookkeeping. The performance of the proposed algorithms, hybrid variants, and competitors is studied in a comprehensive evaluation using real-world benchmark data consisting of Web-search–result rankings and entity rankings based on Wikipedia.},

	abstract = {Inverted indexing based on vector quantization has been a popular technique in large scale information retrieval. With vector quantization based on a certain similarity metric, the sample space is partitioned into some voronoi cells, and samples in each cell are indexed by an inverted list. The nearest neighbors of a query are efficiently identified by looking up the cell where the query is located. To improve the recall, the sample space partitioning has been performed multiple times with different initializations of k-means to build multiple inverted indexes. While with the single similarity metric, e.g., Euclidean distance, high correlation may exist between multiple inverted indexes, which constrains the possible gain in recall. A new multiple inverted indexing method based on multiple sample space partitioning with multiple different similarity metrics is presented in this paper. Furthermore, several techniques for defining multiple metrics are investigated empirically. Experiments are conducted on 3 representative datasets, million-scale SIFT and GIST feature sets and a deep-learning-produced feature set, to properly evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiment results show that the proposed method has competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art inverted indexing methods in terms of recall and retrieval time, and the Latin-Hypercube weighting method can generate better diverse multiple metrics and get better gain in recall.},

This non-linear probabilistic model enables us to go beyond the limited modeling capacity of linear factor models which still largely dominate collaborative filtering research. We introduce a generative model with multinomial likelihood and use Bayesian inference for parameter estimation. Despite widespread use in language modeling and economics, the multinomial likelihood receives less attention in the recommender systems literature. We introduce a different regularization parameter for the learning objective, which proves to be crucial for achieving competitive performance. Remarkably, there is an efficient way to tune the parameter using annealing. The resulting model and learning algorithm has information-theoretic connections to maximum entropy discrimination and the information bottleneck principle. Empirically, we show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines, including two recently-proposed neural network approaches, on several real-world datasets. We also provide extended experiments comparing the multinomial likelihood with other commonly used likelihood functions in the latent factor collaborative filtering literature and show favorable results. Finally, we identify the pros and cons of employing a principled Bayesian inference approach and characterize settings where it provides the most significant improvements.},

	abstract = {Automatic playlist continuation is a prominent problem in music recommendation. Significant portion of music consumption is now done online through playlists and playlist-like online radio stations. Manually compiling playlists for consumers is a highly time consuming task that is difficult to do at scale given the diversity of tastes and the large amount of musical content available. Consequently, automated playlist continuation has received increasing attention recently [1, 7, 11]. The 2018 ACM RecSys Challenge [14] is dedicated to evaluating and advancing current state-of-the-art in automated playlist continuation using a large scale dataset released by Spotify. In this paper we present our approach to this challenge. We use a two-stage model where the first stage is optimized for fast retrieval, and the second stage re-ranks retrieved candidates maximizing the accuracy at the top of the recommended list. Our team vl6 achieved 1’st place in both main and creative tracks out of over 100 teams.},

The target user’s proﬁle is built based on his similarity with other users. For this reason, CF technique is very sensitive to the similarity measure used to quantify the dependency strength between two users (or two items). In this paper we provide an in-depth review on similarity measures used for CF-based RS. For each measure, we outline its fundamental background and we test its performance through an experimental study. Experiments are carried out on three standard datasets (MovieLens100k, MovieLens1M and Jester) and reveal many important conclusions. In fact, results show that ITR and IPWR are the most suitable similarity measures for a user-based RS while AMI is the best choice for an item-based RS. Evaluation metrics show that under the user-based approach, ITR obtains an MAE equal to 0.786 and 0.731 on MovieLens100k and MovieLens1M, respectively. Whereas, IPWR reach an MAE equal to 3.256 on Jester. Also, AMI gets under the item-based approach an MAE equal to 0.745, 0.724 and 3.281 on MovieLens100k, MovieLens1M and Jester, respectively.},

However, this algorithm suffers in the execution time with an increased number of items. Therefore, this study proposes a new recommendation algorithm that combines the matrix decomposition method and ranking aggregation to reduce the time complexity. The matrix decomposition method utilizes singular decomposition value (SVD) to predict the unrated items. The ranking aggregation method applies weight point rank (WPR) to obtain the recommended items. The experimental results with the MovieLens 100K dataset result in a faster running time of 13.502 s. In addition, the normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) score increased by 27.11\% compared to the WP-Rank algorithm.},

Hybrid recommender systems combine two or more recommendation strategies in different ways to beneﬁt from their complementary advantages. This systematic literature review presents the state of the art in hybrid recommender systems of the last decade. It is the ﬁrst quantitative review work completely focused in hybrid recommenders. We address the most relevant problems considered and present the associated data mining and recommendation techniques used to overcome them. We also explore the hybridization classes each hybrid recommender belongs to, the application domains, the evaluation process and proposed future research directions. Based on our ﬁndings, most of the studies combine collaborative ﬁltering with another technique often in a weighted way. Also cold-start and data sparsity are the two traditional and top problems being addressed in 23 and 22 studies each, while movies and movie datasets are still widely used by most of the authors. As most of the studies are evaluated by comparisons with similar methods using accuracy metrics, providing more credible and user oriented evaluations remains a typical challenge. Besides this, newer challenges were also identiﬁed such as responding to the variation of user context, evolving user tastes or providing cross-domain recommendations. Being a hot topic, hybrid recommenders represent a good basis with which to respond accordingly by exploring newer opportunities such as contextualizing recommendations, involving parallel hybrid algorithms, processing larger datasets, etc.},

	abstract = {Collaborative filtering identifies information interest of a particular user based on the information provided by other similar users. The memory-based approaches for collaborative filtering (e.g., Pearson correlation coefficient approach) identify the similarity between two users by comparing their ratings on a set of items. In these approaches, different items are weighted either equally or by some predefined functions. The impact of rating discrepancies among different users has not been taken into consideration. For example, an item that is highly favored by most users should have a smaller impact on the user-similarity than an item for which different types of users tend to give different ratings. Even though simple weighting methods such as variance weighting try to address this problem, empirical studies have shown that they are ineffective in improving the performance of collaborative filtering. In this paper, we present an optimization algorithm to automatically compute the weights for different items based on their ratings from training users. More specifically, the new weighting scheme will create a clustered distribution for user vectors in the item space by bringing users of similar interests closer and separating users of different interests more distant. Empirical studies over two datasets have shown that our new weighting scheme substantially improves the performance of the Pearson correlation coefficient method for collaborative filtering.},

Such rich annotations enable the development of powerful algorithms in clothes recognition and facilitating future researches.

	abstract = {The new coronavirus 2019, also known as COVID19, is a very serious epidemic that has killed thousands or even millions of people since December 2019. It was deﬁned as a pandemic by the world health organization in March 2020. It is stated that this virus is usually transmitted by droplets caused by sneezing or coughing, or by touching infected surfaces. The presence of the virus is detected by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) tests with the help of a swab taken from the nose or throat. In addition, X-ray and CT imaging methods are also used to support this method. Since it is known that the accuracy sensitivity in rRT-PCR test is low, auxiliary diagnostic methods have a very important place. Computer-aided diagnosis and detection systems are developed especially with the help of X-ray and CT images. Studies on the detection of COVID19 in the literature are increasing day by day. In this study, the effect of different batch size (BH=3, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50) parameter values on their performance in detecting COVID19 and other classes was investigated using data belonging to 4 different (Viral Pneumonia, COVID19, Normal, Bacterial Pneumonia) classes. The study was carried out using a pre-trained ResNet50 convolutional neural network. According to the obtained results, they performed closely on the training and test data. However, it was observed that the steady state in the test data was delayed as the batch size value increased. The highest COVID19 detection was 95.17\% for BH = 3, while the overall accuracy value was 97.97\% with BH = 20. According to the ﬁndings, it can be said that the batch size value does not affect the overall performance signiﬁcantly, but the increase in the batch size value delays obtaining stable results.},

However, these deep models are perceived as ”black box” methods considering the lack of understanding of their internal functioning. There has been a signiﬁcant recent interest in developing explainable deep learning models, and this paper is an effort in this direction. Building on a recently proposed method called Grad-CAM, we propose a generalized method called Grad-CAM++ that can provide better visual explanations of CNN model predictions, in terms of better object localization as well as explaining occurrences of multiple object instances in a single image, when compared to state-of-the-art. We provide a mathematical derivation for the proposed method, which uses a weighted combination of the positive partial derivatives of the last convolutional layer feature maps with respect to a speciﬁc class score as weights to generate a visual explanation for the corresponding class label. Our extensive experiments and evaluations, both subjective and objective, on standard datasets showed that Grad-CAM++ provides promising human-interpretable visual explanations for a given CNN architecture across multiple tasks including classiﬁcation, image caption generation and 3D action recognition; as well as in new settings such as knowledge distillation.},

	abstract = {We propose a technique for producing ‘visual explanations’ for decisions from a large class of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models, making them more transparent. Our approach – Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept (say logits for ‘dog’ or even a caption), ﬂowing into the ﬁnal convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches, GradCAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g. VGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g. captioning), (3) CNNs used in tasks with multi-modal inputs (e.g. visual question answering) or reinforcement learning, without architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with existing ﬁne-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization, Guided Grad-CAM, and apply it to image classiﬁcation, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classiﬁcation models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into failure modes of these models (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have reasonable explanations), (b) outperform previous methods on the ILSVRC-15 weakly-supervised localization task, (c) are more faithful to the underlying model, and (d) help achieve model generalization by identifying dataset bias. For image captioning and VQA, our visualizations show even non-attention based models can localize inputs. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM explanations help users establish appropriate trust in predictions from deep networks and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a ‘stronger’ deep network from a ‘weaker’ one even when both make identical predictions.

One of the most attractive applications includes monitoring of gait disorder patients, tracking their disease progression and the modiﬁcation/evaluation of drugs. This paper proposes a robust, wearable gait motion data acquisition system that allows either the classiﬁcation of recorded gait data into desirable activities or the identiﬁcation of common risk factors, thus enhancing the subject’s quality of life. Gait motion information was acquired using accelerometers and gyroscopes mounted on the lower limbs, where the sensors were exposed to inertial forces during gait. Additionally, leg muscle activity was measured using strain gauge sensors. As a matter of fact, we wanted to identify different gait activities within each gait recording by utilizing Machine Learning algorithms. In line with this, various Machine Learning methods were tested and compared to establish the best-performing algorithm for the classiﬁcation of the recorded gait information. The combination of attention-based convolutional and recurrent neural networks algorithms outperformed the other tested algorithms and was individually tested further on the datasets of ﬁve subjects and delivered the following averaged results of classiﬁcation: 98.9\% accuracy, 96.8\% precision, 97.8\% sensitivity, 99.1\% speciﬁcity and 97.3\% F1-score. Moreover, the algorithm’s robustness was also veriﬁed with the successful detection of freezing gait episodes in a Parkinson’s disease patient.

	abstract = {Falls in the home environment are a primary cause of injury in older adults. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, every year, one in four adults 65 years of age and older reports experiencing a fall. A variety of different technologies have been proposed to detect fall events. However, the need to detect all fall instances (i.e., to avoid false negatives) has led to the development of systems marked by high sensitivity and hence a signiﬁcant number of false alarms. The occurrence of false alarms causes frequent and unnecessary calls to emergency response centers, which are critical resources that should be utilized only when necessary. Besides, false alarms decrease the level of conﬁdence of end-users in the fall detection system with a negative impact on their compliance with using the system (e.g., wearing the sensor enabling the detection of fall events). Herein, we present a novel approach aimed to augment traditional fall detection systems that rely on wearable sensors and fall detection algorithms. The proposed approach utilizes a UWB-based tracking system and a home robot. When the fall detection system generates an alarm, the alarm is relayed to a base station that utilizes a UWB-based tracking system to identify where the older adult and the robot are so as to enable navigating the environment using the robot and reaching the older adult to check if he/she experienced a fall. This approach prevents unnecessary calls to emergency response centers while enabling a tele-presence using the robot when appropriate. In this paper, we report the results of a novel fall detection algorithm, the characteristics of the alarm notiﬁcation system, and the accuracy of the UWB-based tracking system that we implemented. The fall detection algorithm displayed a sensitivity of 99.0\% and a speciﬁcity of 97.8\%. The alarm notiﬁcation system relayed all simulated alarm notiﬁcation instances with a maximum delay of 106 ms. The UWB-based tracking system was found to be suitable to locate radio tags both in line-of-sight and in no-line-of-sight conditions. This result was obtained by using a machine learning-based algorithm that we developed to detect and compensate for the multipath effect in no-line-of-sight conditions. When using this algorithm, the error affecting the estimated position of the radio tags was smaller than 0.2 m, which is satisfactory for the application at hand.},

            Wearable sensors and machine learning algorithms are becoming a viable alternative for biomechanical analysis outside of the laboratory. The purpose of this work was to estimate gait events from inertial measurement units (IMUs) and utilize machine learning for the estimation of ground reaction force (GRF) waveforms. Sixteen healthy runners were recruited for this study, with varied running experience. Force sensing insoles were used to measure normal foot-shoe forces, providing a proxy for vertical GRF and a standard for the identification of gait events. Three IMUs were mounted on each participant, two bilaterally on the dorsal aspect of each foot and one clipped to the back of each participant’s waistband, approximating their sacrum. Participants also wore a GPS watch to record elevation and velocity. A Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Network (BD-LSTM) was used to estimate GRF waveforms from inertial waveforms. Gait event estimation from both IMU data and machine learning algorithms led to accurate estimations of contact time. The GRF magnitudes were generally underestimated by the machine learning algorithm when presented with data from a novel participant, especially at faster running speeds. This work demonstrated that estimation of GRF waveforms is feasible across a range of running velocities and at different grades in an uncontrolled environment.},

A total of 960 inertial sensors were virtually attached to the lower extremities of a validated biomechanical model and shoe model. Walking of hemiparetic patients was simulated using motion capture data (kinematic simulation). Accelerations and angular velocities were synthesised according to the inertial sensor models. A comprehensive error analysis of detected gait events
              versus
              reference gait events of each simulated sensor position across all segments was performed. For gait event detection, we considered 1-, 2-, and 4-phase gait models. Results of hemiparetic patients showed superior gait event estimation performance for a sensor fusion of angular velocity and acceleration data with lower nMAEs (9\%) across all sensor positions compared to error estimation with acceleration data only. Depending on algorithm choice and parameterisation, gait event detection performance increased up to 65\%. Our results suggest that user personalisation of IMU placement should be pursued as a first priority for gait phase detection, while sensor position variation may be a secondary adaptation target. When comparing rotatory and translatory error components per body segment, larger interquartile ranges of rotatory errors were observed for all phase models i.e., repositioning the sensor around the body segment axis was more harmful than along the limb axis for gait phase detection. The proposed co-simulation framework is suitable for evaluating different sensor modalities, as well as gait event detection algorithms for different gait phase models. The results of our analysis open a new path for utilising biomechanical human digital twins in wearable system design and performance estimation before physical device prototypes are deployed.},

However, a large number of samples are required for training models when using deep learning, where the amount of available gait-related data may be limited for several reasons. This paper discusses certain techniques that can be applied to enable the use of deep learning for gait analysis in case of limited availability of data. Recent studies on the clinical applications of deep learning for gait analysis are also reviewed, and the compatibility between these applications and sensing modalities is determined. This article also provides a broad overview of publicly available gait databases for different sensing modalities.},

	abstract = {Gait recognition aims at identifying a person at a distance through visual cameras. With the emergence of deep learning, signiﬁcant advancements in gait recognition have achieved inspiring success in many scenarios by utilizing deep learning techniques. Nevertheless, the increasing need for video surveillance introduces more challenges, including robust recognition under various variances, modeling motion information in gait sequences, unfair performance comparison due to protocol variances, biometrics security, and privacy prevention. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of deep learning for gait recognition. We ﬁrst present the odyssey of gait recognition from traditional algorithms to deep models, providing explicit knowledge of the whole workﬂow of a gait recognition system. Then deep learning for gait recognition is discussed from the perspective of deep representations and architecture with an in-depth summary. Speciﬁcally, deep gait representations are categorized into static and dynamic features, while deep architectures include single-stream and multi-stream architecture. Following our proposed taxonomy with novelty, it can be beneﬁcial for providing inspiration and promoting the perception of deep gait recognition. Besides, we also present a comprehensive summary of all vision-based gait datasets and the performance analysis. Finally, the article discusses some open issues with signiﬁcant potential prospects.},

	abstract = {Sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder that causes repeated breathing interruption during sleep. The performance of automated apnea detection methods based on respiratory signals depend on the signals considered and feature extraction methods. Moreover, feature engineering techniques are highly dependent on the experts’ experience and their prior knowledge about different physiological signals and conditions of the subjects. To overcome these problems, a novel deep recurrent neural network (RNN) framework is developed for automated feature extraction and detection of apnea events from single respiratory channel inputs. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) are investigated to develop the proposed deep RNN model. The proposed framework is evaluated over three respiration signals: Oronasal thermal airﬂow (FlowTh), nasal pressure (NPRE), and abdominal respiratory inductance plethysmography (ABD). To demonstrate our results, we use polysomnography (PSG) data of 17 patients with obstructive, central, and mixed apnea events. Our results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in automatic extraction for temporal features and automated detection of apneic events over the different respiratory signals considered in this study. Using a deep BiLSTM-based detection model, the NPRE signal achieved the highest overall detection results with true positive rate (sensitivity) = 90.3\%, true negative rate (speciﬁcity) = 83.7\%, and area under receiver operator characteristic curve = 92.4\%. The present results contribute a new deep learning approach for automated detection of sleep apnea events from single channel respiration signals that can potentially serve as a helpful and alternative tool for the traditional PSG method.},

	abstract = {Lower limb exoskeletons require the correct support magnitude and timing to achieve user assistance. This study evaluated whether the sign of the angular velocity of lower limb segments can be used to determine the timing of the stance and the swing phase during walking. We assumed that stance phase is characterized by a positive, swing phase by a negative angular velocity. Thus, the transitions can be used to also identify heel-strike and toe-off. Thirteen subjects without gait impairments walked on a treadmill at speeds between 0.5 and 2.1 m/s on level ground and inclinations between −10 and +10◦. Kinematic and kinetic data was measured simultaneously from an optical motion capture system, force plates, and ﬁve inertial measurement units (IMUs). These recordings were used to compute the angular velocities of four lower limb segments: two biological (thigh, shank) and two virtual that were geometrical projections of the biological segments (virtual leg, virtual extended leg). We analyzed the reliability (two sign changes of the angular velocity per stride) and the accuracy (offset in timing between sign change and ground reaction force based timing) of the virtual and biological segments for detecting the gait phases stance and swing. The motion capture data revealed that virtual limb segments seem superior to the biological limb segments in the reliability of stance and swing detection. However, increased signal noise when using the IMUs required additional rule sets for reliable stance and swing detection. With IMUs, the biological shank segment had the least variability in accuracy. The IMU-based heel-strike events of the shank and both virtual segment were slightly early (3.3–4.8\% of the gait cycle) compared to the ground reaction force-based timing. Toe-off event timing showed more variability (9.0\% too early to 7.3\% too late) between the segments and changed with walking speed. The results show that the detection of the heel-strike, and thus stance phase, based on IMU angular velocity is possible for different segments when additional rule sets are included. Further work is required to improve the timing accuracy for the toe-off detection (swing).},

Our main contribution is an approach that explains class-specific characteristics learned by ML models that are trained for gait classification. We investigate several gait classification tasks and employ different classification methods, i.e., Convolutional Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Multi-layer Perceptron. We propose to evaluate the obtained explanations with two complementary approaches: a statistical analysis of the underlying data using Statistical Parametric Mapping and a qualitative evaluation by two clinical experts. A gait dataset comprising ground reaction force measurements from 132 patients with different lower-body gait disorders and 62 healthy controls is utilized. Our experiments show that explanations obtained by LRP exhibit promising statistical properties concerning inter-class discriminativity and are also in line with clinically relevant biomechanical gait characteristics.},

	abstract = {Compared to other biometrics, gait is difﬁcult to conceal and has the advantage of being unobtrusive. Inertial sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, are often used to capture gait dynamics. These inertial sensors are commonly integrated into smartphones and are widely used by the average person, which makes gait data convenient and inexpensive to collect. In this paper, we study gait recognition using smartphones in the wild. In contrast to traditional methods, which often require a person to walk along a speciﬁed road and/or at a normal walking speed, the proposed method collects inertial gait data under unconstrained conditions without knowing when, where, and how the user walks. To obtain good person identiﬁcation and authentication performance, deep-learning techniques are presented to learn and model the gait biometrics based on walking data. Speciﬁcally, a hybrid deep neural network is proposed for robust gait feature representation, where features in the space and time domains are successively abstracted by a convolutional neural network and a recurrent neural network. In the experiments, two datasets collected by smartphones for a total of 118 subjects are used for evaluations. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves higher than 93.5\% and 93.7\% accuracies in person identiﬁcation and authentication, respectively.},

However, due to personal diversity between individuals, it is a challenge for robots to detect a gait event at various stride frequencies. This paper proposes a novel method for gait event detection of a gait rehabilitation robot using a single inertial sensor mounted on the thigh. A self-adaptive threshold for detecting heel strike is obtained in real time via a linear regression model. Observable thresholds for toe off detection are constant at various stride frequencies. Experiments are conducted based on 20 healthy subjects and six hemiplegic patients wearing a gait rehabilitation robot and walking at various kinds of stride frequencies. The experimental results show that the proposed method can detect heel strike and toe off gait events within an average 2\% gait cycle temporal errors and never miss two-gait event detection. Compared to the conventional thresholding method, this work presents a simple and robust application for gait event detection in healthy and hemiplegic subjects by one inertial sensor. The linear regression model can be applicable to different subjects walking at various stride frequencies.},

In this work, we improve upon traditional anomaly detection methods by introducing Isudra, an Indirectly Supervised Detector of Relevant Anomalies from time series data. Isudra employs Bayesian optimization to select time scales, features, base detector algorithms, and algorithm hyperparameters that increase true positive and decrease false positive detection. This optimization is driven by a small amount of example anomalies, driving an indirectly supervised approach to anomaly detection. Additionally, we enhance the approach by introducing a warm-start method that reduces optimization time between similar problems. We validate the feasibility of Isudra to detect clinically relevant behavior anomalies from over 2M sensor readings collected in five smart homes, reflecting 26 health events. Results indicate that indirectly supervised anomaly detection outperforms both supervised and unsupervised algorithms at detecting instances of health-related anomalies such as falls, nocturia, depression, and weakness.},

	abstract = {Segmenting the gait cycle into multiple phases using gait event detection (GED) is a wellresearched subject with many accurate algorithms. However, the algorithms that are able to perform accurate and robust GED for real-life environments and physical diseases tend to be too complex for their implementation on simple hardware systems limited in computing power and memory, such as those used in wearable devices. This study focuses on a numerical implementation of a reservoir computing (RC) algorithm called the echo state network (ESN) that is based on simple computational steps that are easy to implement on portable hardware systems for real-time detection. RC is a neural network method that is widely used for signal processing applications and uses a fast-training method based on a ridge regression adapted to the large quantity and variety of IMU data needed to use RC in various real-life environment GED. In this study, an ESN was used to perform ofﬂine GED with gait data from IMU and ground force sensors retrieved from three databases for a total of 28 healthy adults and 15 walking conditions. Our main ﬁnding is that despite its low complexity, ESN is robust for GED, with performance comparable to other state-of-the-art algorithms. Our results show the ESN is robust enough to obtain good detection results in all conditions if the algorithm is trained with variable data that match those conditions. The distribution of the mean absolute errors (MAE) between the detection times from the ESN and the force sensors were between 40 and 120 ms for 6 deﬁned gait events (95th percentile). We compared our ESN with four different state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature. The ESN obtained a MAE not more than 10 ms above three other reference algorithms for normal walking indoor and outdoor conditions and yielded the 2nd lowest MAE and the 2nd highest true positive rate and speciﬁcity when applied to outdoor walking and running conditions. Our work opens the door to using the ESN as a GED for applications in wearable sensors for long-term patient monitoring.},

	abstract = {Research on pre-impact fall detection with wearable inertial sensors (detecting fall accidents prior to body-ground impacts) has grown rapidly in the past decade due to its great potential for developing an on-demand fall-related injury prevention system. However, most researchers use their own datasets to develop fall detection algorithms and rarely make these datasets publicly available, which poses a challenge to fairly evaluate the performance of different algorithms on a common basis. Even though some open datasets have been established recently, most of them are impractical for pre-impact fall detection due to the lack of temporal labels for fall time and limited types of motions. In order to overcome these limitations, in this study, we proposed and publicly provided a large-scale motion dataset called “KFall,” which was developed from 32 Korean participants while wearing an inertial sensor on the low back and performing 21 types of activities of daily living and 15 types of simulated falls. In addition, ready-to-use temporal labels of the fall time based on synchronized motion videos were published along with the dataset. Those enhancements make KFall the first public dataset suitable for pre-impact fall detection, not just for post-fall detection. Importantly, we have also developed three different types of latest algorithms (threshold based, support-vector machine, and deep learning), using the KFall dataset for pre-impact fall detection so that researchers and practitioners can flexibly choose the corresponding algorithm. Deep learning algorithm achieved both high overall accuracy and balanced sensitivity (99.32\%) and specificity (99.01\%) for pre-impact fall detection. Support vector machine also demonstrated a good performance with a sensitivity of 99.77\% and specificity of 94.87\%. However, the threshold-based algorithm showed relatively poor results, especially the specificity (83.43\%) was much lower than the sensitivity (95.50\%). The performance of these algorithms could be regarded as a benchmark for further development of better algorithms with this new dataset. This large-scale motion dataset and benchmark algorithms could provide researchers and practitioners with valuable data and references to develop new technologies and strategies for pre-impact fall detection and proactive injury prevention for the elderly.},

	abstract = {The current gold standard of gait diagnostics is dependent on large, expensive motioncapture laboratories and highly trained clinical and technical staff. Wearable sensor systems combined with machine learning may help to improve the accessibility of objective gait assessments in a broad clinical context. However, current algorithms lack ﬂexibility and require large training datasets with tedious manual labelling of data. The current study tests the validity of a novel machine learning algorithm for automated gait partitioning of laboratory-based and sensor-based gait data. The developed artiﬁcial intelligence tool was used in patients with a central neurological lesion and severe gait impairments. To build the novel algorithm, 2\% and 3\% of the entire dataset (567 and 368 steps in total, respectively) were required for assessments with laboratory equipment and inertial measurement units. The mean errors of machine learning-based gait partitions were 0.021 s for the laboratory-based datasets and 0.034 s for the sensor-based datasets. Combining reinforcement learning with a deep neural network allows signiﬁcant reduction in the size of the training datasets to {\textless}5\%. The low number of required training data provides end-users with a high degree of ﬂexibility. Non-experts can easily adjust the developed algorithm and modify the training library depending on the measurement system and clinical population.},

	abstract = {To understand daily events accurately, adaptive pose estimation (APE) systems require a robust context-aware model and optimal feature selection methods. In this paper, we propose a novel gait event detection (GED) system that consists of saliency silhouette detection, a robust body parts model and a 2D stick-model followed by a hierarchical optimization algorithm. Furthermore, the most prominent context-aware features such as energy, 0–180° intensity and distinct moveable features are proposed by focusing on invariant and localized characteristics of human postures in different event classes. Finally, we apply Grey Wolf optimization and a genetic algorithm to discriminate complex postures and to provide appropriate labels to each event. In order to evaluate the performance of proposed GED, two public benchmark datasets, UCF101 and YouTube, are examined via the n-fold cross validation method. For the two benchmark datasets, our proposed method detects the human body key points with 82.4\% and 83.2\% accuracy respectively. Also, it extracts the context-aware features and finally recognizes the gait events with 82.6\% and 85.0\% accuracy, respectively. Compared with other well-known statistical and state-of-the-art methods, our proposed method outperforms other similarly tasked methods in terms of posture detection and recognition accuracy.},

	abstract = {Neuromotor pathologies often cause motor deficits and deviations from typical locomotion, reducing the quality of life. Clinical gait analysis is used to effectively classify these motor deficits to gain deeper insights into resulting walking behaviours. To allow the ensemble averaging of spatio-temporal metrics across individuals during walking, gait events, such as initial contact (IC) or toe-off (TO), are extracted through either manual annotation based on video data, or through force thresholds using force plates. This study developed a deeplearning long short-term memory (LSTM) approach to detect IC and TO automatically based on foot-marker kinematics of 363 cerebral palsy subjects (age: 11.8 ± 3.2). These footmarker kinematics, including 3D positions and velocities of the markers located on the hallux (HLX), calcaneus (HEE), distal second metatarsal (TOE), and proximal fifth metatarsal (PMT5), were extracted retrospectively from standard barefoot gait analysis sessions. Different input combinations of these four foot-markers were evaluated across three gait subgroups (IC with the heel, midfoot, or forefoot). For the overall group, our approach detected 89.7\% of ICs within 16ms of the true event with a 18.5\% false alarm rate. For TOs, only 71.6\% of events were detected with a 33.8\% false alarm rate. While the TOE{\textbar}HEE marker combination performed well across all subgroups for IC detection, optimal performance for TO detection required different input markers per subgroup with performance differences of 5-10\%. Thus, deep-learning LSTM based detection of IC events using the TOE{\textbar}HEE markers offers an automated alternative to avoid operator-dependent and laborious manual annotation, as well as the limited step coverage and inability to measure assisted walking for force plate-based detection of IC events.},

Thanks to the rapid development of sensor networks and the Internet of Things (IoT), human-computer interaction using sensor fusion has been regarded as an effective method to address the problem of fall detection. In this paper, we provide a literature survey of work conducted on elderly fall detection using sensor networks and IoT. Although there are various existing studies which focus on the fall detection with individual sensors, such as wearable ones and depth cameras, the performance of these systems are still not satisfying as they suffer mostly from high false alarms. Literature shows that fusing the signals of different sensors could result in higher accuracy and lower false alarms, while improving the robustness of such systems. We approach this survey from different perspectives, including data collection, data transmission, sensor fusion, data analysis, security, and privacy. We also review the benchmark data sets available that have been used to quantify the performance of the proposed methods. The survey is meant to provide researchers in the ﬁeld of elderly fall detection using sensor networks with a summary of progress achieved up to date and to identify areas where further effort would be beneﬁcial.},

	abstract = {Background:  Identification of individual gait events is essential for clinical gait analysis, because it can be used for diagnostic purposes or tracking disease progression in neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s disease. Previous research has shown that gait events can be detected from a shank-mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU), however detection performance was often evaluated only from straight-line walking. For use in daily life, the detection performance needs to be evaluated in curved walking and turning as well as in single-task and dual-task conditions.
Methods:  Participants (older adults, people with Parkinson’s disease, or people who had suffered from a stroke) performed three different walking trials: (1) straight-line walking, (2) slalom walking, (3) Stroop-and-walk trial. An optical motion capture system was used a reference system. Markers were attached to the heel and toe regions of the shoe, and participants wore IMUs on the lateral sides of both shanks. The angular velocity of the shank IMUs was used to detect instances of initial foot contact (IC) and final foot contact (FC), which were compared to reference values obtained from the marker trajectories.
Results:  The detection method showed high recall, precision and F1 scores in different populations for both initial contacts and final contacts during straight-line walking (IC: recall = 100\%, precision = 100\%, F1 score = 100\%; FC: recall = 100\%, precision = 100\%, F1 score = 100\%), slalom walking (IC: recall = 100\%, precision ≥ 99\%, F1 score = 100\%; FC: recall = 100\%, precision ≥ 99\%, F1 score =100\%), and turning (IC: recall ≥ 85\%, precision ≥ 95\%, F1 score ≥ 91\%; FC: recall ≥ 84\%, precision ≥ 95\%, F1 score ≥89\%).
Conclusions:  Shank-mounted IMUs can be used to detect gait events during straight-line walking, slalom walking and turning. However, more false events were observed during turning and more events were missed during turning. For use in daily life we recommend identifying turning before extracting temporal gait parameters from identified gait events.},

This study fosters a reliable gait event detection system that can operate at diverse gait speeds and on diverse real-life terrains by detecting several gait events in real-time. This detection only relies on the foot angular velocity measured by a wearable gyroscope mounted in the foot to facilitate its integration for daily and repeated use. To operate as a benchmark tool, the proposed detection system endows an adaptive computational method by applying a finitestate-machine based on heuristic decision rules dependent on adaptive thresholds. Repeated measurements from eleven healthy subjects (28.27±4.17 years) were acquired in controlled situations through a treadmill at different speeds (from 1.5 km/h to 4.5 km/h) and slopes (0\% to 10\%). This validation also includes heterogenous gait patterns from nine healthy subjects (27±7.35 years) monitored at three self-selected paces (from 1±0.2 m/s to 2±0.18 m/s) during forward walking on flat, rough, and inclined surfaces and climbing staircases. The proposed method was significantly more accurate (p{\textgreater}0.9925) and time-effective ({\textless}30.53±9.88ms, p{\textgreater}0.9314) in a benchmarking analysis with a state-of-the-art method during 5657 steps. Heel Strike was the gait event most accurately detected under controlled (accuracy of 100\%) and real-life situations (accuracy{\textgreater}96.98\%). Misdetection was more pronounced in Middle Mid-Swing (accuracy{\textgreater}90.12\%). The lower computational load, together with an improved performance, makes this detection system suitable for quantitative benchmarking in the locomotor rehabilitation field.},

	abstract = {Objective: A novel method based on the application of the Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator is presented to estimate instances of initial contact (IC) and final contact (FC) from accelerometry during gait. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated against four existing gait event detection (GED) methods under three walking conditions designed to capture the variance of gait in real-world environments. Methods: A symmetric discrete approximation of the Teager-Kaiser energy operator was used to capture simultaneous amplitude and frequency modulations of the shank acceleration signal at IC and FC during flat treadmill walking, inclined treadmill walking, and flat indoor walking. Accuracy of estimated gait events were determined relative to gait events detected using force-sensitive resistors. The performance of the proposed algorithm was assessed against four established methods by comparing mean-absolute error, sensitivity, precision and F1-score values. Results: The proposed method demonstrated high accuracy for GED in all walking conditions, yielding higher F1-scores (IC: {\textgreater}0.98, FC: {\textgreater}0.9) and lower mean-absolute errors (IC: {\textless}0.018s, FC: {\textless}0.039s) than other methods examined. Estimated ICs from shank-based methods tended to exhibit unimodal distributions preceding the forcesensitive resistor estimated ICs, whereas estimated gait events for waist-based methods had quasi-uniform random distributions and lower accuracy. Conclusion: Compared to established gait event detection methods, the proposed method yielded comparably high accuracy for IC detection, and was more accurate than all other methods examined for FC detection. Significance: The results support the use of the Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator for accurate automated GED across a range of walking conditions.},

Unlike laboratory systems, such systems do not use kinetic data from force plates, rather, gait events such as initial contact (IC) and terminal contact (TC) are estimated from video and sensor signals. There are, however, detection errors inherent in kinematic gait event detection methods (GEDM) and comparative study between classic laboratory and video/sensor-based systems is warranted. For this study, three kinematic methods: coordinate based treadmill algorithm (CBTA), shank angular velocity (SK), and foot velocity algorithm (FVA) were compared to ‘gold standard’ force plate methods (GS) for determining IC and TC in adults (n = 6), typically developing children (n = 5) and children with cerebral palsy (n = 6). The root mean square error (RMSE) values for CBTA, SK, and FVA were 27.22, 47.33, and 78.41 ms, respectively. On average, GED was detected earlier in CBTA and SK (CBTA: −9.54 ± 0.66 ms, SK: −33.41 ± 0.86 ms) and delayed in FVA (21.00 ± 1.96 ms). The statistical model demonstrated insensitivity to variations in group, side, and individuals. Out of three kinematic GEDMs, SK GEDM can best be used for sensor-based gait event detection.},

	abstract = {We performed an electronic database search of published works from 2012 to mid-2021 that focus on human gait studies and apply machine learning techniques. We identiﬁed six key applications of machine learning using gait data: 1) Gait analysis where analyzing techniques and certain biomechanical analysis factors are improved by utilizing artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms, 2) Health and Wellness, with applications in gait monitoring for abnormal gait detection, recognition of human activities, fall detection and sports performance, 3) Human Pose Tracking using one-person or multi-person tracking and localization systems such as OpenPose, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), etc., 4) Gait-based biometrics with applications in person identiﬁcation, authentication, and re-identiﬁcation as well as gender and age recognition 5) “Smart gait” applications ranging from smart socks, shoes, and other wearables to smart homes and smart retail stores that incorporate continuous monitoring and control systems and 6) Animation that reconstructs human motion utilizing gait data, simulation and machine learning techniques. Our goal is to provide a single broad-based survey of the applications of machine learning technology in gait analysis and identify future areas of potential study and growth. We discuss the machine learning techniques that have been used with a focus on the tasks they perform, the problems they attempt to solve, and the trade-offs they navigate.},

	abstract = {In the past few years there has been increased interest in using data-mining techniques to extract interesting patterns from time series data generated by sensors monitoring temporally varying phenomenon. Most work has assumed that raw data is somehow processed to generate a sequence of events, which is then mined for interesting episodes. In some cases the rule for determining when a sensor reading should generate an event is well known. However, if the phenomenon is ill-understood, stating such a rule is difficult. Detection of events in such an environment is the focus of this paper. Consider a dynamic phenomenon whose behavior changes enough over time to be considered a qualitatively significant change. The problem we investigate is of identifying the time points at which the behavior change occurs. In the statistics literature this has been called the change-point detection problem. The standard approach has been to (a) upriori determine the number of change-points that are to be discovered, and (b) decide the function that will be used for curve fitting in the interval between successive change-points. In this paper we generalize along both these dimensions. We propose an iterative algorithm that fits a model to a time segment, and uses a likelihood criterion to determine if the segment should be partitioned further, i.e. if it contains a new changepoint. In this paper we present algorithms for both the batch and incremental versions of the problem, and evaluate their behavior with synthetic and real data. Finally, we present initial results comparing the change-points detected by the batch algorithm with those detected by people using visual inspection.},

	abstract = {Many algorithms use 3D accelerometer and/or gyroscope data from inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors to detect gait events (i.e., initial and final foot contact). However, these algorithms often require knowledge about sensor orientation and use empirically derived thresholds. As alignment cannot always be controlled for in ambulatory assessments, methods are needed that require little knowledge on sensor location and orientation, e.g., a convolutional neural network-based deep learning model. Therefore, 157 participants from healthy and neurologically diseased cohorts walked 5 m distances at slow, preferred, and fast walking speed, while data were collected from IMUs on the left and right ankle and shank. Gait events were detected and stride parameters were extracted using a deep learning model and an optoelectronic motion capture (OMC) system for reference. The deep learning model consisted of convolutional layers using dilated convolutions, followed by two independent fully connected layers to predict whether a time step corresponded to the event of initial contact (IC) or ﬁnal contact (FC), respectively. Results showed a high detection rate for both initial and ﬁnal contacts across sensor locations (recall ≥ 92\%, precision ≥ 97\%). Time agreement was excellent as witnessed from the median time error (0.005 s) and corresponding inter-quartile range (0.020 s). The extracted stride-speciﬁc parameters were in good agreement with parameters derived from the OMC system (maximum mean difference 0.003 s and corresponding maximum limits of agreement (−0.049 s, 0.051 s) for a 95\% conﬁdence level). Thus, the deep learning approach was considered a valid approach for detecting gait events and extracting stride-speciﬁc parameters with little knowledge on exact IMU location and orientation in conditions with and without walking pathologies due to neurological diseases.},

While multiple algorithms have been developed, the impact of gait event timing errors on temporal parameters and asymmetry has never been investigated in people with transfemoral amputation walking freely on level ground. In this study, five algorithms were comparatively assessed on gait data of seven people with transfemoral amputation, equipped with three IMUs mounted at the pelvis and both shanks, using pressure insoles for reference. Algorithms’ performance was first quantified in terms of gait event detection rate (sensitivity, positive predictive value). Only two algorithms, based on shank mounted IMUs, achieved an acceptable detection rate (positive predictive value {\textgreater} 99\%). For these two, accuracy of gait events timings, temporal parameters, and absolute symmetry index of stance-phase duration (SPD-ASI) were assessed. Whereas both algorithms achieved high accuracy for stride duration estimates (median errors: 0\%, interquartile ranges {\textless} 1.75\%), lower accuracy was found for other temporal parameters due to relatively high errors in the detection of final contact events. Furthermore, SPD-ASI derived from IMU-based algorithms proved to be significantly different to that obtained from insoles data.},

	abstract = {Automatic computer-based seizure detection and warning devices are important for objective seizure documentation, for SUDEP prevention, to avoid seizure related injuries and social embarrassments as a consequence of seizures, and to develop on demand epilepsy therapies. Automatic seizure detection systems can be based on direct analysis of epileptiform discharges on scalp-EEG or intracranial EEG, on the detection of motor manifestations of epileptic seizures using surface electromyography (sEMG), accelerometry (ACM), video detection systems and mattress sensors and ﬁnally on the assessment of changes of physiologic parameters accompanying epileptic seizures measured by electrocardiography (ECG), respiratory monitors, pulse oximetry, surface temperature sensors, and electrodermal activity. Here we review automatic seizure detection based on scalp-EEG, ECG, and sEMG. Different seizure types affect preferentially different measurement parameters. While EEG changes accompany all types of seizures, sEMG and ACM are suitable mainly for detection of seizures with major motor manifestations. Therefore, seizure detection can be optimized by multimodal systems combining several measurement parameters. While most systems provide sensitivities over 70\%, speciﬁcity expressed as false alarm rates still needs to be improved. Patients’ acceptance and comfort of a speciﬁc device are of critical importance for its long-term application in a meaningful clinical way.},

Smartphones are equipped with a variety of sensors. Fusing the data of these sensors could enable applications to recognize a large number of activities. Realizing this goal is challenging, however. Firstly, these devices are low on resources, which limits the number of sensors that can be utilized. Secondly, to achieve optimum performance efficient feature extraction, feature selection and classification methods are required. This work implements a smartphone-based HAR scheme in accordance with these requirements. Time domain features are extracted from only three smartphone sensors, and a nonlinear discriminatory approach is employed to recognize 15 activities with a high accuracy. This approach not only selects the most relevant features from each sensor for each activity but it also takes into account the differences resulting from carrying a phone at different positions. Evaluations are performed in both offline and online settings. Our comparison results show that the proposed system outperforms some previous mobile phone-based HAR systems.},

The modern smartwatch offers the potential for data from sensors to be relayed to novel IoT platforms, which allow the constant tracking and monitoring of human movement and behavior. Recently, traditional activity recognition techniques have done research in advance by choosing machine learning methods such as artificial neural network, decision tree, support vector machine, and naive Bayes. Nonetheless, these conventional machine learning techniques depend inevitably on heuristically handcrafted feature extraction, in which human domain knowledge is normally limited. This work proposes a hybrid deep learning model called CNN-LSTM that employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for activity recognition with the Convolution Neural Network (CNN). The study makes use of HAR involving smartwatches to categorize hand movements. Using the study based on the Wireless Sensor Data Mining (WISDM) public benchmark dataset, the recognition abilities of the deep learning model can be accessed. The accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure statistics are employed using the evaluation metrics to assess the recognition abilities of LSTM models proposed. The findings indicate that this hybrid deep learning model offers better performance than its rivals, where the achievement of 96.2\% accuracy, while the f-measure is 96.3\%, is obtained. The results show that the proposed CNN-LSTM can support an improvement of the performance of activity recognition.},

	abstract = {Background:
              In order to remain active and productive, older adults with poor health require
a combination of advanced methods of visual monitoring, optimization, pattern recognition, and learning,
which provide safe and comfortable environments and serve as a tool to facilitate the work of family
members and workers, both at home and in geriatric homes. Therefore, there is a need to develop
technologies to provide these adults autonomy in indoor environments.
            
            
              Objective:
              This study aimed to generate a prediction model of daily living activities through classification
techniques and selection of characteristics in order to contribute to the development in this area of
knowledge, especially in the field of health. Moreover, the study aimed to accurately monitor the activities
of the elderly or people with disabilities. Technological developments allow predictive analysis of
daily life activities, contributing to the identification of patterns in advance in order to improve the
quality of life of the elderly.
            
            
              Method:
              The vanKasteren, CASAS Kyoto, and CASAS Aruba datasets were used to validate a predictive
model capable of supporting the identification of activities in indoor environments. These datasets
have some variation in terms of occupation and the number of daily living activities to be identified.
            
            
              Results:
              Twelve classifiers were implemented, among which the following stand out: Classification via
Regression, OneR, Attribute Selected, J48, Random SubSpace, RandomForest, RandomCommittee,
Bagging, Random Tree, JRip, LMT, and REP Tree. The classifiers that show better results when identifying
daily life activities are analyzed in the light of precision and recall quality metrics. For this
specific experimentation, the Classification via Regression and OneR classifiers obtain the best results.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              The efficiency of the predictive model based on classification is concluded, showing the
results of the two classifiers, i.e., Classification via Regression and OneR, with quality metrics higher
than 90\% even when the datasets vary in occupation and number of activities.},

	abstract = {Human activity recognition (HAR) has increased in recent years due to its applications in mobile health monitoring, activity recognition, and patient rehabilitation. The typical approach is training a HAR classifier offline with known users and then using the same classifier for new users. However, the accuracy for new users can be low with this approach if their activity patterns are different than those in the training data. At the same time, training from scratch for new users is not feasible for mobile applications due to the high computational cost and training time. To address this issue, we propose a HAR transfer learning framework with two components. First, a representational analysis reveals common features that can transfer across users and user-specific features that need to be customized. Using this insight, we transfer the reusable portion of the offline classifier to new users and fine-tune only the rest. Our experiments with five datasets show up to 43\% accuracy improvement and 66\% training time reduction when compared to the baseline without using transfer learning. Furthermore, measurements on the hardware platform reveal that the power and energy consumption decreased by 43\% and 68\%, respectively, while achieving the same or higher accuracy as training from scratch. Our code is released for reproducibility.

There is a wide range of applications within the field; for instance, assisted living, security surveillance, and intelligent transportation. In HAR, the development of Activity Recognition models is dependent upon the data captured by these devices and the methods used to analyse them, which directly affect performance metrics. In this work, we address the issue of accurately recognising human activities using different Machine Learning (ML) techniques. We propose a new feature representation based on consecutive occurring observations and compare it against previously used feature representations using a wide range of classification methods. Experimental results demonstrate that techniques based on the proposed representation outperform the baselines and a better accuracy was achieved for both highly and less frequent actions. We also investigate how the addition of further features and their pre-processing techniques affect performance results leading to state-of-the-art accuracy on a Human Activity Recognition dataset.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Healthcare using body sensor data has been getting huge research attentions by a wide range of researchers because of its good practical applications such as smart health care systems. For instance, smart wearable sensor-based behavior recognition system can observe elderly people in a smart eldercare environment to improve their lifestyle and can also help them by warning about forthcoming unprecedented events such as falls or other health risk, to prolong their independent life. Although there are many ways of using distinguished sensors to observe behavior of people, wearable sensors mostly provide reliable data in this regard to monitor the individual’s functionality and lifestyle. In this paper, we propose a body sensor-based activity modeling and recognition system using time-sequential information-based deep Neural Structured Learning (NSL), a promising deep learning algorithm. First, we obtain data from multiple wearable sensors while the subjects conduct several daily activities. Once the data is collected, the time-sequential information then go through some statistical feature processing. Furthermore, kernel-based discriminant analysis (KDA) is applied to see the better clustering of the features from different activity classes by minimizing inner-class scatterings while maximizing inter-class scatterings of the samples. The robust time-sequential features are then applied with Neural Structured Learning (NSL) based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), for activity modeling. The proposed approach achieved around 99\% recall rate on a public dataset. It is also compared to existing different conventional machine learning methods such as typical Deep Belief Network (DBN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) where they yielded the maximum recall rate of 94\%. Furthermore, a fast and efficient explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) algorithm, Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) is used to explain and check the machine learning decisions. The robust activity recognition system can be adopted for understanding peoples' behavior in their daily life in different environments such as homes, clinics, and offices.},

	abstract = {Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating motor phenomenon that is common among individuals with advanced Parkinson’s disease. Objective and sensitive measures are needed to better quantify FOG. The present work addresses this need by leveraging wearable devices and machine-learning methods to develop and evaluate automated detection of FOG and quantification of its severity. Seventy-one subjects with FOG completed a FOG-provoking test while wearing three wearable sensors (lower back and each ankle). Subjects were videotaped before (OFF state) and after (ON state) they took their antiparkinsonian medications. Annotations of the videos provided the “ground-truth” for FOG detection. A leave-one-patient-out validation process with a training set of 57 subjects resulted in 84.1\% sensitivity, 83.4\% specificity, and 85.0\% accuracy for FOG detection. Similar results were seen in an independent test set (data from 14 other subjects). Two derived outcomes, percent time frozen and number of FOG episodes, were associated with self-report of FOG. Both derived-metrics were higher in the OFF state than in the ON state and in the most challenging level of the FOG-provoking test, compared to the least challenging level. These results suggest that this automated machine-learning approach can objectively assess FOG and that its outcomes are responsive to therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for women all over the world. Since the reason of breast cancer is unknown, early detection of the disease plays an important role in cancer control, saving lives and reducing costs. Among different modalities, automated 3-D breast ultrasound (3-D ABUS) is a new and effective imaging modality which has attracted a lot of interest as an adjunct to mammography for women with dense breasts. However, reading ABUS images is time consuming for radiologists and subtle abnormalities may be overlooked. Hence, computer aided detection (CADe) systems can be utilized as a second interpreter to assist radiologists to increase their screening speed and sensitivity. In this paper, a general architecture representing different CADe systems for ABUS images is introduced and the approaches for implementation of each block are categorized and reviewed. In addition, the limitations of these systems are discussed and their performance in terms of sensitivity and number of false positives per volume are compared.},

	abstract = {Background: Diagnosing breast cancer masses and calcification clusters have paramount significance in mammography, which aids in mitigating the disease’s complexities and curing it at early stages. However, a wrong mammogram interpretation may lead to an unnecessary biopsy of the false-positive findings, which reduces the patient’s survival chances. Consequently, approaches that learn to discern breast masses can reduce the number of misconceptions and incorrect diagnoses. Conventionally used classification models focus on feature extraction techniques specific to a particular problem based on domain information. Deep learning strategies are becoming promising alternatives to solve the many challenges of feature-based approaches. Methods: This study introduces a convolutional neural network (ConvNet)-based deep learning method to extract features at varying densities and discern mammography’s normal and suspected regions. Two different experiments were carried out to make an accurate diagnosis and classification. The first experiment consisted of five end-to-end pre-trained and fine-tuned deep convolution neural networks (DCNN). The in-depth features extracted from the ConvNet are also used to train the support vector machine algorithm to achieve excellent performance in the second experiment. Additionally, DCNN is the most frequently used image interpretation and classification method, including VGGNet, GoogLeNet, MobileNet, ResNet, and DenseNet. Moreover, this study pertains to data cleaning, preprocessing, and data augmentation, and improving mass recognition accuracy. The efficacy of all models is evaluated by training and testing three mammography datasets and has exhibited remarkable results. Results: Our deep learning ConvNet+SVM model obtained a discriminative training accuracy of 97.7\% and validating accuracy of 97.8\%, contrary to this, VGGNet16 method yielded 90.2\%, 93.5\% for VGGNet19, 63.4\% for GoogLeNet, 82.9\% for MobileNetV2, 75.1\% for ResNet50, and 72.9\% for DenseNet121. Conclusions: The proposed model’s improvement and validation are appropriated in conventional pathological practices that conceivably reduce the pathologist’s strain in predicting clinical outcomes by analyzing patients’ mammography images.},

	abstract = {Background: Identification and treatment of breast cancer at an early stage can reduce mortality. Currently, mammography is the most widely used effective imaging technique in breast cancer detection. However, an erroneous mammogram based interpretation may result in false diagnosis rate, as distinguishing cancerous masses from adjacent tissue is often complex and error-prone. Methods: Six pre-trained and fine-tuned deep CNN architectures: VGG16, VGG19, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, DenseNet201, and InceptionV3 are evaluated to determine which model yields the best performance. We propose a BreastNet18 model using VGG16 as foundational base, since VGG16 performs with the highest accuracy. An ablation study is performed on BreastNet18, to evaluate its robustness and achieve the highest possible accuracy. Various image processing techniques with suitable parameter values are employed to remove artefacts and increase the image quality. A total dataset of 1442 preprocessed mammograms was augmented using seven augmentation techniques, resulting in a dataset of 11,536 images. To investigate possible overfitting issues, a k-fold cross validation is carried out. The model was then tested on noisy mammograms to evaluate its robustness. Results were compared with previous studies. Results: Proposed BreastNet18 model performed best with a training accuracy of 96.72\%, a validating accuracy of 97.91\%, and a test accuracy of 98.02\%. In contrast to this, VGGNet19 yielded test accuracy of 96.24\%, MobileNetV2 77.84\%, ResNet50 79.98\%, DenseNet201 86.92\%, and InceptionV3 76.87\%. Conclusions: Our proposed approach based on image processing, transfer learning, fine-tuning, and ablation study has demonstrated a high correct breast cancer classification while dealing with a limited number of complex medical images.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in Australia with crude incidence rates increasing drastically from 62.8 at ages 35-39 to 271.4 at ages 50-54 (cases per 100,000 women). Various researchers have proposed methods and tools based on Machine Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks for assessing mammographic images, but these methods have produced detection and interpretation errors resulting in false-positive and false-negative cases when used in the real world. We believe that this problem can potentially be resolved by implementing effective image pre-processing techniques to create training data for Deep-CNN. Therefore, the main aim of this research is to propose effective image pre-processing methods to create datasets that can save computational time for the neural network and improve accuracy and classiﬁcation rates. To do so, this research proposes methods for background removal, pectoral muscle removal, adding noise to the images, and image enhancements. Adding noise without affecting the quality of details in the images makes the input images for the neural network more representative, which may improve the performance of the neural network model when used in the real world. The proposed method for background removal is the ‘‘Rolling Ball Algorithm’’ and ‘‘Huang’s Fuzzy Thresholding’’, which succeed in removing background from 100\% of the images. For pectoral muscle removal ‘‘Canny Edge Detection’’ and ‘‘Hough’s Line Transform’’ are used, which removed muscle from 99.06\% of the images. ‘‘Invert’’, ‘‘CTI\_RAS’’ and ‘‘ISOCONTOUR’’ lookup tables (LUTs) were used for image enhancements to outline the ROIs and regions within the ROIs.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death among women, behind only heart disease. However, despite the high incidence and mortality rates associated with breast cancer, it is still unclear as to what is responsible for its development in the first place. The prevention of breast cancer is not possible with any of the current available methods. Patients who are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer at an early stage have a better chance of having a successful treatment and recovery. In the field of breast cancer detection, digital mammography is widely acknowledged to be a highly effective method of detecting the disease early on. We may be able to improve early detection of breast cancer with the use of image processing techniques, thereby boosting our chances of survival and treatment success. This article discusses a breast cancer image processing and machine learning framework that was developed. The input data set for this framework is a sequence of mammography images, which are used as input data. The CLAHE approach is then utilized to improve the overall quality of the photographs by means of image processing. It is called contrast restricted adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), and it is an improvement on the original histogram equalization technique. This aids in the removal of noise from photographs while simultaneously improving picture quality. The segmentation of images is the next step in the framework’s development. An image is divided into distinct portions at this point because the pixels are labeled at this step. This assists in the identification of objects and the delineation of boundaries. To categorize these preprocessed images, techniques such as fuzzy SVM, Bayesian classifier, and random forest are employed, among others.},

But there are some jeopardy factors such as age, gene, obesity, taking birth control pills and smoking. Normally breast cancer is a malignant tumour that initiates in the cells of the breast and eventually it extents to the surrounding tissues. The disease can be preserved if it is detected early. As stages increase, the chance of preserving decreases. There are numerous imaging techniques that play a vital role in detecting breast cancer.

	abstract = {Mammography is the most preferred method for breast cancer screening. In this study, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems were used to improve the image quality of mammography images and to detect suspicious areas. The main contribution of this study is to reveal the optimal combination of various pre-processing algorithms to enable better interpretation and classiﬁcation of mammography images because pre-processing algorithms signiﬁcantly affect the accuracy of segmentation and classiﬁcation methods. In this study, the effect of combinations of different preprocessing methods in differentiating benign and malignant breast lesions was investigated. All image processing algorithms used for lesion detection were used in the mini-MIAS database. In the ﬁrst step, label information and pectoral muscle resulting from the acquisition of mammography images were removed. In the second step, median ﬁlter (MF), contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), and unsharp masking (USM) algorithms with different combinations of the resolution and visibility of images are increased. In the third step, suspicious regions are extracted from the mammograms using the k-means clustering technique. Then, features were extracted from the obtained ROIs. Finally, feature datasets were classiﬁed as normal/abnormal, and benign/malign (two class classiﬁcation) using Machine Learning algorithms. Test performance measures of the classiﬁcation methods were examined. In both classiﬁcations made in the study, lower classiﬁcation performance values were obtained when the CLAHE algorithm was used alone as a pre-processing method compared to other pre-processing combinations. When the median ﬁlter and unsharp masking algorithms are added to the CLAHE algorithm, the performance of the classiﬁcation methods has increased. In terms of classiﬁcation success, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Neural Networks showed the best performance. It was found by comparing the performances of the classiﬁcation methods that different preprocessing algorithms were effective in detecting the presence of breast lesions and distinguishing benign and malignant.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is widespread worldwide and can be cured if diagnosed early. Using digital mammogram images and image processing with artiﬁcial intelligence can play an essential role in breast cancer diagnosis. As many computerized algorithms for breast cancer diagnosis have signiﬁcant limitations, such as noise handling and varying or low contrast in the images, it can be difﬁcult to segment the abnormal region. These challenges could be overcome by proposing a new preprocessing model, exploring its impact on the post-processing module, and testing it on an extensive database. In this research work, the three-step method is proposed and validated on large databases of mammography images. The ﬁrst step corresponded to the database classiﬁcation, followed by the second step, which removed the pectoral muscle from the mammogram image. The third stage utilized new image-enhancement techniques and a new segmentation module to detect abnormal regions in a well-enhanced image to diagnose breast cancer. The pre-and post-processing modules are based on novel image processing techniques. The proposed method was tested using data collected from different hospitals in the Qassim Health Cluster, Qassim Province, Saudi Arabia. This database contained the ﬁve categories in the Breast Imaging and Reporting and Data System and consisted of 2892 images; the proposed method is analyzed using the publicly available Mammographic Image Analysis Society database, which contained 322 images. The proposed method gives good contrast enhancement with peak-signal to noise ratio improvement of 3 dB. The proposed method provides an accuracy of approximately 92\% on 2892 images of Qassim Health Cluster, Qassim Province, Saudi Arabia. The proposed method gives approximately 97\% on the Mammographic Image Analysis Society database. The novelty of the proposed work is that it could work on all Breast Imaging and Reporting and Data System categories. The performance of the proposed method demonstrated its ability to improve the diagnostic performance of the computerized breast cancer detection method.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this diagnostic study, 16 802 DBT examinations with at least 1 reconstruction view available, performed between August 26, 2014, and January 29, 2018, were obtained from Duke Health System and analyzed. From the initial cohort, examinations were divided into 4 groups and split into training and test sets for the development and evaluation of a deep learning model. Images with foreign objects or spot compression views were excluded. Data analysis was conducted from January 2018 to October 2020. EXPOSURES Screening DBT. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The detection algorithm was evaluated with breast-based free-response receiver operating characteristic curve and sensitivity at 2 false positives per volume.
RESULTS The curated data set contained 22 032 reconstructed DBT volumes that belonged to 5610 studies from 5060 patients with a mean (SD) age of 55 (11) years and 5059 (100.0\%) women. This included 4 groups of studies: (1) 5129 (91.4\%) normal studies; (2) 280 (5.0\%) actionable studies, for which where additional imaging was needed but no biopsy was performed; (3) 112 (2.0\%) benign biopsied studies; and (4) 89 studies (1.6\%) with cancer. Our data set included masses and architectural distortions that were annotated by 2 experienced radiologists. Our deep learning model reached breast-based sensitivity of 65\% (39 of 60; 95\% CI, 56\%-74\%) at 2 false positives per DBT volume on a test set of 460 examinations from 418 patients.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The large, diverse, and curated data set presented in this study could facilitate the development and evaluation of artificial intelligence algorithms for breast cancer screening by providing data for training as well as a common set of cases for model validation. The performance of the model developed in this study showed that the task remains challenging; its performance could serve as a baseline for future model development.},

	abstract = {Background: The limitations of traditional computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for mammography, the extreme importance of early detection of breast cancer and the high impact of the false diagnosis of patients drive researchers to investigate deep learning (DL) methods for mammograms (MGs). Recent breakthroughs in DL, in particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable advances in the medical fields. Specifically, CNNs are used in mammography for lesion localization and detection, risk assessment, image retrieval, and classification tasks. CNNs also help radiologists providing more accurate diagnosis by delivering precise quantitative analysis of suspicious lesions.
Results: In this survey, we conducted a detailed review of the strengths, limitations, and performance of the most recent CNNs applications in analyzing MG images. It summarizes 83 research studies for applying CNNs on various tasks in mammography. It focuses on finding the best practices used in these research studies to improve the diagnosis accuracy. This survey also provides a deep insight into the architecture of CNNs used for various tasks. Furthermore, it describes the most common publicly available MG repositories and highlights their main features and strengths.
Conclusions: The mammography research community can utilize this survey as a basis for their current and future studies. The given comparison among common publicly available MG repositories guides the community to select the most appropriate database for their application(s). Moreover, this survey lists the best practices that improve the performance of CNNs including the pre-processing of images and the use of multi-view images. In addition, other listed techniques like transfer learning (TL), data augmentation, batch normalization, and dropout are appealing solutions to reduce overfitting and increase the generalization of the CNN models. Finally, this survey identifies the research challenges and directions that require further investigations by the community.},

	abstract = {Early breast cancer detection is one of the most important issues that need to be addressed worldwide as it can help increase the survival rate of patients. Mammograms have been used to detect breast cancer in the early stages; if detected in the early stages, it can drastically reduce treatment costs. The detection of tumours in the breast depends on segmentation techniques. Segmentation plays a significant role in image analysis and includes detection, feature extraction, classification, and treatment. Segmentation helps physicians quantify the volume of tissue in the breast for treatment planning. In this work, we have grouped segmentation methods into three groups: classical segmentation that includes region-, threshold-, and edge-based segmentation; machine learning segmentation; and supervised and unsupervised and deep learning segmentation. The findings of our study revealed that region-based segmentation is frequently used for classical methods, and the most frequently used techniques are region growing. Further, a median filter is a robust tool for removing noise. Moreover, the MIAS database is frequently used in classical segmentation methods. Meanwhile, in machine learning segmentation, unsupervised machine learning methods are more frequently used, and U-Net is frequently used for mammogram image segmentation because it does not require many annotated images compared with other deep learning models. Furthermore, reviewed papers revealed that it is possible to train a deep learning model without performing any preprocessing or postprocessing and also showed that the U-Net model is frequently used for mammogram segmentation. The U-Net model is frequently used because it does not require many annotated images and also because of the presence of high-performance GPU computing, which makes it easy to train networks with more layers. Additionally, we identified mammograms and utilised widely used databases, wherein 3 and 28 are public and private databases, respectively.},

In the conventional machine learning approach, the domain experts in medical images are mandatory for image annotation that subsequently to be used for feature engineering. However, in deep learning, a big jump has been made to help the researchers do segmentation, feature extraction, classification, and detection from raw medical images obtained using digital breast tomosynthesis, digital mammography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound imaging modalities. As a result, deep learning (DL) has gained a state-of-the-art in many application areas, for example, breast cancer image analysis. In this survey paper, we reviewed the most common breast cancer imaging modalities, public, most cited and recently updated breast cancer databases, histopathological based breast cancer image analysis, and DL application types in medical image analysis. We finally conclude by pointing out the research gaps to be addressed in the future.},

	abstract = {Accurate segmentation of breast mass in 3D automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) plays an important role in breast cancer analysis. Deep convolutional networks have become a promising approach in segmenting ABUS images. However, designing an effective network architecture is time-consuming, and highly relies on specialist’s experience and prior knowledge. To address this issue, we introduce a searchable segmentation network (denoted as Auto-DenseUNet) based on the neural architecture search (NAS) to search the optimal architecture automatically for the ABUS mass segmentation task. Concretely, a novel search space is designed based on a densely connected structure to enhance the gradient and information flows throughout the network. Then, to encourage multiscale information fusion, a set of searchable multiscale aggregation nodes between the down-sampling and up-sampling parts of the network are further designed. Thus, all the operators within the dense connection structure or between any two aggregation nodes can be searched to find the optimal structure. Finally, a novel decoupled search training strategy during architecture search is also introduced to alleviate the memory limitation caused by continuous relaxation in NAS. The proposed Auto-DeseUNet method has been evaluated on our ABUS dataset with 170 volumes (from 107 patients), including 120 training volumes and 50 testing volumes split at patient level. Experimental results on testing volumes show that our searched architecture performed better than several human-designed segmentation models on the 3D ABUS mass segmentation task, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of breast caner detection from multi-view mammograms. We present a novel cross-view attention module (CvAM) which implicitly learns to focus on the cancerrelated local abnormal regions and highlighting salient features by exploring cross-view information among four views of a screening mammography exam, e.g. asymmetries between left and right breasts and lesion correspondence between two views of the same breast. More speciﬁcally, the proposed CvAM calculates spatial attention maps based on the same view of different breasts to enhance bilateral asymmetric regions, and channel attention maps based on two different views of the same breast to enhance the feature channels corresponding to the same lesion in a single breast. CvAMs can be easily integrated into standard convolutional neural networks (CNN) architectures such as ResNet to form a multi-view classiﬁcation model. Experiments are conducted on DDSM dataset, and results show that CvAMs can not only provide better classiﬁcation accuracy over non-attention and single-view attention models, but also demonstrate better abnormality localization power using CNN visualization tools.},

	abstract = {Mammography is one of the most commonly applied tools for early breast cancer screening. Automatic segmentation of breast masses in mammograms is essential but challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the wide variety of mass shapes and sizes. Existing methods deal with these challenges mainly by extracting mass-centered image patches manually or automatically. However, manual patch extraction is time-consuming and automatic patch extraction brings errors that could not be compensated in the following segmentation step. In this study, we propose a novel attention-guided dense-upsampling network (AUNet) for accurate breast mass segmentation in whole mammograms directly. In AUNet, we employ an asymmetrical encoder–decoder structure and propose an effective upsampling block, attention-guided dense-upsampling block (AU block). Especially, the AU block is designed to have three merits. Firstly, it compensates the information loss of bilinear upsampling by dense upsampling. Secondly, it designs a more effective method to fuse high- and low-level features. Thirdly, it includes a channel-attention function to highlight rich-information channels. We evaluated the proposed method on two publicly available datasets, CBIS-DDSM and INbreast. Compared to three state-of-the-art fully convolutional networks, AUNet achieved the best performances with an average Dice similarity coefficient of 81.8\% for CBIS-DDSM and 79.1\% for INbreast.},

	abstract = {Screening for breast cancer with mammography has been introduced in various countries over the last 30 years, initially using analog screen-film-based systems and, over the last 20 years, transitioning to the use of fully digital systems. With the introduction of digitization, the computer interpretation of images has been a subject of intense interest, resulting in the introduction of computer-aided detection (CADe) and diagnosis (CADx) algo­ rithms in the early 2000′s. Although they were introduced with high expectations, the potential improvement in the clinical realm failed to materialize, mostly due to the high number of false positive marks per analyzed image. In the last five years, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution in computing, driven mostly by deep learning and convolutional neural networks, has also pervaded the field of automated breast cancer detection in digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis. Research in this area first involved comparison of its capabil­ ities to that of conventional CADe/CADx methods, which quickly demonstrated the potential of this new tech­ nology. In the last couple of years, more mature and some commercial products have been developed, and studies of their performance compared to that of experienced breast radiologists are showing that these algorithms are on par with human-performance levels in retrospective data sets. Although additional studies, especially pro­ spective evaluations performed in the real screening environment, are needed, it is becoming clear that AI will have an important role in the future breast cancer screening realm. Exactly how this new player will shape this field remains to be determined, but recent studies are already evaluating different options for implementation of this technology.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate visually and quantitatively the performance of a deep-learning-based super-resolution (SR) model for microcalcifications in digital mammography.
Method: Mammograms were consecutively collected from 5080 patients who underwent breast cancer screening from January 2015 to March 2017. Of these, 93 patients (136 breasts, mean age, 50 ± 7 years) had micro­ calcifications in their breasts on mammograms. We applied an artificial intelligence model known as a fast SR convolutional neural network to the mammograms. SR and original mammograms were visually evaluated by four breast radiologists using a 5-point scale (1: original mammograms are strongly preferred, 5: SR mammo­ grams are strongly preferred) for the detection, diagnostic quality, contrast, sharpness, and noise of micro­ calcifications. Mammograms were quantitatively evaluated using a perception-based image-quality evaluator (PIQE).
Results: All radiologists rated the SR mammograms better than the original ones in terms of detection, diagnostic quality, contrast, and sharpness of microcalcifications. These ratings were significantly different according to the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p {\textless}.001), while the noise score of the three radiologists was significantly lower (p {\textless}.001). According to PIQE, SR mammograms were rated better than the original mammograms, showing a significant difference by paired t-test (p {\textless}.001).
Conclusion: An SR model based on deep learning can improve the visibility of microcalcifications in mammog­ raphy and help detect and diagnose them in mammograms.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Breast cancer is the cancer with the highest incidence in women, and early detection can effectively improve the survival rate of patients. Mammography is an important method for physicians to screening breast cancer, but the diagnosis of mammograms by physicians depends largely on clinical practice experience. Studies have shown that using computer-aided diagnosis techniques can help doctors diagnose breast cancer.
Methods: In this paper, the method of convolutional neural network is mainly used to classify benign and malignant breast masses in the mammograms. First, we use multi-scale residual networks and densely connected networks as backbone networks to extract the features of global image patches and local image patches. Second, we use the attention module named convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to improve the two feature extraction networks to enhance the network’s feature expression ability. Finally, we fuse the features of multi-scale image patches to achieve the classification of benign and malignant breast masses.
Results: In the digital database for screening mammography (DDSM) database, the accuracy, sensitivity, AUC value and corresponding standard deviation of our method are 0.9626 Æ 0.0110, 0.9719 Æ 0.0126, and 0.9576 Æ 0.0064, respectively. Compared with the commonly used ResNet (AUC = 0.8823 Æ 0.0112) and DenseNet (AUC = 0.9141 Æ 0.0085), the performance of our method has improved. In addition, we also used the INbreast database to train and validate the proposed method. The accuracy, sensitivity, AUC and corresponding standard deviations are 0.9554 Æ 0.0296, 0.9605 Æ 0.0228, and 0.9468 Æ 0.0085, respectively.
Conclusions: Compared with the previous work, our proposed method uses multi-scale image features, has better classification performance in breast mass patches classification tasks, and can effectively assist physicians in breast cancer diagnosis. © 2021 American Association of Physicists in Medicine [https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.14942]},

	abstract = {Breast tumor is one of the most prominent indicators for the diagnosis of breast cancer. The precise segmentation of tumors is crucial for enhancing the accuracy of breast cancer detection. A physician’s assessment of the MRI scan is time-consuming and require a lot of human effort and expertise. Furthermore, traditional medical segmentation approaches frequently need prior information or manual feature extraction, resulting in a subjective diagnosis. Therefore, the development of an automated image segmentation approach is essential for clinical applications. This work presents BTS-GAN, an automatic breast tumor segmentation process using conditional GAN (cGAN) in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. First, we used an encoder-decoder deep network with skip connections between encoder and decoder for the generator to increase the localization efﬁciency. Second, we utilized a parallel dilated convolution (PDC) module to retain the features of various sizes of masses and to effectively extract information about the masses’ edges and interior texture. Third, an extra classiﬁcation-related constraint is included to the loss function of the cGAN for mitigating the hard-to-converge challenge in image-toimage (I2I) translation tasks based on classiﬁcation. The generator side of our proposed model learns to detect the tumor and construct a binary mask, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between ground truth and synthetic masks, driving the generator to produce masks as genuine as possible. The experimental results demonstrate that our BTS-GAN is more efﬁcient and reliable for breast tumor segmentation and outperform other segmentation techniques in terms of the IoU and Dice coefﬁcient on the publicly available RIDER breast cancer MRI dataset. Our proposed model achieved an average IoU and Dice scores of 77\% and 85\% respectively.},

	abstract = {Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is an emerging breast cancer screening and diagnostic modality that uses quasi-three-dimensional breast images to provide detailed assessments of the dense tissue within the breast. In this study, a framework of a 3D-Mask region-based convolutional neural network (3D-Mask RCNN) computeraided diagnosis (CAD) system was developed for mass detection and segmentation with a comparative analysis of performance on patient subgroups with different clinicopathological characteristics. To this end, 364 samples of DBT data were used and separated into a training dataset (n = 201) and a testing dataset (n = 163). The detection and segmentation results were evaluated on the testing set and on subgroups of patients with different characteristics, including different age ranges, lesion sizes, histological types, lesion shapes and breast densities. The results of our 3D-Mask RCNN framework were compared with those of the 2D-Mask RCNN and Faster RCNN methods. For lesion-based mass detection, the sensitivity of 3D-Mask RCNN-based CAD was 90\% with 0.8 false positives (FPs) per lesion, whereas the sensitivity of the 2D-Mask RCNN- and Faster RCNN-based CAD was 90\% at 1.3 and 2.37 FPs/lesion, respectively. For breast-based mass detection, the 3D-Mask RCNN generated a sensitivity of 90\% at 0.83 FPs/breast, and this framework is better than the 2D-Mask RCNN and Faster RCNN, which generated a sensitivity of 90\% with 1.24 and 2.38 FPs/breast, respectively. Additionally, the 3D-Mask RCNN achieved signiﬁcantly (p {\textless} 0.05) better performance than the 2D methods on subgroups of samples with characteristics of ages ranged from 40 to 49 years, malignant tumors, spiculate and irregular masses and dense breast, respectively. Lesion segmentation using the 3DMask RCNN achieved an average precision (AP) of 0.934 and a false negative rate (FNR) of 0.053, which are better than those achieved by the 2D methods. The results suggest that the 3D-Mask RCNN CAD framework has advantages over 2D-based mass detection on both the whole data and subgroups with different characteristics.},

Also, the sensitivity of mammographic screening varies with image quality and expertise of the radiologist. So, there is no golden standard for the screening process. To offset this variability and to standardize the diagnostic procedures, efforts are being made to develop automated techniques for diagnosis and grading of breast cancer images. A few papers have documented the general trend of computer-aided diagnosis of breast cancer, making a broad study of the several techniques involved. But, there is no deﬁnitive documentation focusing on the mathematical techniques used in breast cancer detection.

In this paper, we discuss problems related to mammographic image preprocessing and accurate segmentation. We review specific methods that were commonly used in most of the techniques proposed for segmentation of mammograms and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Comparative analysis of the methods reported on is made difficult by variations in the datasets and procedures of evaluation used by the authors. We attempt to overcome some of these limitations by trying to compare methods which used the same dataset and have some similarities in approaches to the breast boundary segmentation and detection of the pectoral muscle. In this paper, we will address the most often used methods for segmentation such as thresholding, morphology, region growing, active contours, and wavelet filtering. These methods, or their combinations, are the ones most used in the last decade by the majority of work published in this image processing domain.},

              The rapid development of deep learning, a family of machine learning techniques, has spurred much interest in its application to medical imaging problems. Here, we develop a deep learning algorithm that can accurately detect breast cancer on screening mammograms using an “end-to-end” training approach that efficiently leverages training datasets with either complete clinical annotation or only the cancer status (label) of the whole image. In this approach, lesion annotations are required only in the initial training stage, and subsequent stages require only image-level labels, eliminating the reliance on rarely available lesion annotations. Our all convolutional network method for classifying screening mammograms attained excellent performance in comparison with previous methods. On an independent test set of digitized film mammograms from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM), the best single model achieved a per-image AUC of 0.88, and four-model averaging improved the AUC to 0.91 (sensitivity: 86.1\%, specificity: 80.1\%). On an independent test set of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images from the INbreast database, the best single model achieved a per-image AUC of 0.95, and four-model averaging improved the AUC to 0.98 (sensitivity: 86.7\%, specificity: 96.1\%). We also demonstrate that a whole image classifier trained using our end-to-end approach on the CBIS-DDSM digitized film mammograms can be transferred to INbreast FFDM images using only a subset of the INbreast data for fine-tuning and without further reliance on the availability of lesion annotations. These findings show that automatic deep learning methods can be readily trained to attain high accuracy on heterogeneous mammography platforms, and hold tremendous promise for improving clinical tools to reduce false positive and false negative screening mammography results.

	abstract = {Mammography can be considered as the current gold standard for detecting early signs of breast cancer and is in wide use throughout the world. As conﬁrmed by many studies, breast cancer screening using mammography can reduce breast cancer-related mortality by 30–70\%. However, although the interpretation of mammography images by a second reader has been shown to increase the cancer detection rate, this practice is not widespread due to the cost associated. As a result, computer-aided detection/diagnosis (CAD) of breast mammography has been gaining popularity with various studies illustrating the positive effects of using computers in detecting early breast cancer signs by providing the radiologists with a second opinion with most of these CAD systems requiring the breast outline and pectoral muscle regions (in images acquired using Medio-Lateral-Oblique view) to be segmented from mammograms prior to the classiﬁcation. This paper discusses recent developments and methods proposed for segmenting the breast and pectoral muscle regions and compares the performance and shortcomings of different approaches grouped together based on the techniques used. While it is arduous to compare these methods using comparative analysis, a set of common performance evaluation criterion is deﬁned in this study and various methods are compared based on their methodology and the validation dataset used. Although many methods can achieve promising results, there is still room for further development, especially in pre-processing and image enhancement steps where most methods do not take the necessary steps for ensuring a smooth segmentation of boundaries. In this paper, the most effective pre-processing, image enhancement and segmentation concepts proposed for breast boundary and pectoral muscle segmentation are identiﬁed and discussed in hopes of aiding the readers with identifying the best possible solutions for these segmentation problems.},

Optimistically, there is a good chance of recovery from breast cancer if identiﬁed and treated at an early stage. Therefore, several researchers have established deep-learningbased automated methods for their efﬁciency and accuracy in predicting the growth of cancer cells utilizing medical imaging modalities.

However, these studies were unable to address emerging architectures and modalities in breast cancer diagnosis. This review focuses on the evolving architectures of deep learning for breast cancer detection. In what follows, this survey presents existing deep-learning-based architectures, analyzes the strengths and limitations of the existing studies, examines the used datasets, and reviews image pre-processing techniques.

To detect breast cancer, various imaging modalities can be used, such as mammography. Computer-Aided Detection/Diagnosis (CAD) systems can assist an expert radiologist to diagnose breast cancer at an early stage. This paper introduces the findings of a systematic review that seeks to examine the state-of-the-art CAD systems for breast cancer detection. This review is based on 118 publications published in 2018–2021 and retrieved from major scientific publication databases while using a rigorous methodology of a systematic review. We provide a general description and analysis of existing CAD systems that use machine learning methods as well as their current state based on mammogram image modalities and classification methods. This systematic review presents all stages of CAD including preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. We identify research gaps and outline recom­ mendations for future research. This systematic review may be helpful for both clinicians, who use CAD systems for early diag­ nosis of breast cancer, as well as for researchers to find knowl­ edge gaps and create more contributions for breast cancer diagnostics.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the most common death causes amongst women all over the world. Early detection of breast cancer plays a critical role in increasing the survival rate. Various imaging modalities, such as mammography, breast MRI, ultrasound and thermography, are used to detect breast cancer. Though there is a considerable success with mammography in biomedical imaging, detecting suspicious areas remains a challenge because, due to the manual examination and variations in shape, size, other mass morphological features, mammography accuracy changes with the density of the breast. Furthermore, going through the analysis of many mammograms per day can be a tedious task for radiologists and practitioners. One of the main objectives of biomedical imaging is to provide radiologists and practitioners with tools to help them identify all suspicious regions in a given image. Computer-aided mass detection in mammograms can serve as a second opinion tool to help radiologists avoid running into oversight errors. The scientiﬁc community has made much progress in this topic, and several approaches have been proposed along the way. Following a bottom-up narrative, this paper surveys different scientiﬁc methodologies and techniques to detect suspicious regions in mammograms spanning from methods based on low-level image features to the most recent novelties in AI-based approaches. Both theoretical and practical grounds are provided across the paper sections to highlight the pros and cons of different methodologies. The paper’s main scope is to let readers embark on a journey through a fully comprehensive description of techniques, strategies and datasets on the topic.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer affects thousands of women across the world, every year. Methods to predict risk of breast cancer, or to stratify women in different risk levels, could help to achieve an early diagnosis, and consequently a reduction of mortality. This paper aims to review articles that extracted texture features from mammograms and used those features along with machine learning algorithms to assess breast cancer risk. Besides that, deep learning methodologies that aimed for the same goal were also reviewed. In this work, ﬁrst, a brief introduction to breast cancer statistics and screening programs is presented; after that, research done in the ﬁeld of breast cancer risk assessment are analyzed, in terms of both methodologies used and results obtained. Finally, considerations about the analyzed papers are conducted. The results of this review allow to conclude that both machine and deep learning methodologies provide promising results in the ﬁeld of risk analysis, either in a stratiﬁcation in risk groups, or in a prediction of a risk score. Although promising, future endeavors in this ﬁeld should consider the possibility of the implementation of the methodology in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {This work explores the use of characterization features extracted based on breast-mass contours obtained by automated segmentation methods, for the classification of masses in mammograms according to their diagnosis (benign or malignant). Two sets of mass contours were obtained via two segmentation methods (a dynamic-programming-based method and a constrained region-growing method), and simplified versions of these contours (modeling the contours as ellipses) were employed to extract a set of six features designed for characterization of mass margins (contrast between foreground region and background region, coefficient of variation of edge strength, two measures of the fuzziness of mass margins, a measure of spiculation based on relative gradient orientation, and a measure of spiculation based on edge-signature information). Three popular classifiers (Bayesian classifier, Fisher's linear discriminant, and a support vector machine) were then used to predict the diagnosis of a set of 349 masses based on each of said features and some combinations of these. The systems (each system consists of a segmentation method, a featureset, and a classifier) were compared with each other in terms of their performance on the diagnosis of the set of breast masses. It was found that, although there was a percent difference of about 14\% in the average segmentation quality between methods, this was translated into an average percent difference of only 4\% in the classification performance. It was also observed that the spiculation feature based on edgesignature information was distinctly better than the rest of the features, although it is not very robust to changes in the quality of the segmentation. All systems were more efficient in predicting the diagnosis of benign masses than that of the malignant masses, resulting in low sensitivity and high specificity values (e.g. 0.6 and 0.8, respectively) since the positive class in the classification experiments is the set of malignant masses. It was concluded that features extracted from automated contours can contribute to the diagnosis of breast masses in screening programs by correctly identifying a majority of benign masses. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Large margin classiﬁers like the support vector machine (SVM) have been reported effective in computer-assisted diagnosis systems for breast cancers. However, since the separating hyperplane determination exclusively relies on support vectors, the SVM is essentially a local classiﬁer and its performance can be further improved. In this work, we introduce a structured SVM model to determine if each mammographic region is normal or cancerous by considering the cluster structures in the training set. The optimization problem in this new model can be solved efﬁciently by being formulated as one second order cone programming problem. Experimental evaluation is performed on the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) dataset. Various types of features, including curvilinear features, texture features, Gabor features, and multi-resolution features, are extracted from the sample images. We then select the salient features using the recursive feature elimination algorithm. The structured SVM achieves better detection performance compared with a well-tested SVM classiﬁer in terms of the area under the ROC curve.},

	abstract = {The most common form of cancer among women in both developed and developing countries is breast cancer. The early detection and diagnosis of this disease is significant because it may reduce the number of deaths caused by breast cancer and improve the quality of life of those effected. Computer-aided detection (CADe) and computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) methods have shown promise in recent years for aiding in the human expert reading analysis and improving the accuracy and reproducibility of pathology results. One significant application of CADe and CADx is for breast cancer screening using mammograms. In image processing and machine learning research, relevant results have been produced by sparse analysis methods to represent and recognize imaging patterns. However, application of sparse analysis techniques to the biomedical field is challenging, as the objects of interest may be obscured because of contrast limitations or background tissues, and their appearance may change because of anatomical variability. We introduce methods for label-specific and label-consistent dictionary learning to improve the separation of benign breast masses from malignant breast masses in mammograms. We integrated these approaches into our Spatially Localized Ensemble Sparse Analysis (SLESA) methodology. We performed 10- and 30-fold cross validation (CV) experiments on multiple mammography datasets to measure the classification performance of our methodology and compared it to deep learning models and conventional sparse representation. Results from these experiments show the potential of this methodology for separation of malignant from benign masses as a part of a breast cancer screening workflow.},

	abstract = {Background:  Mammography is one of the most popular tools for early detection of breast cancer. Contour of breast mass in mammography is very important information to distinguish benign and malignant mass. Contour of benign mass is smooth and round or oval, while malignant mass has irregular shape and spiculated contour. Several studies have shown that 1D signature translated from 2D contour can describe the contour features well.
Methods:  In this paper, we propose a new method to translate 2D contour of breast mass in mammography into 1D signature. The method can describe not only the contour features but also the regularity of breast mass. Then we segment the whole 1D signature into different subsections. We extract four local features including a new contour descriptor from the subsections. The new contour descriptor is root mean square (RMS) slope. It can describe the roughness of the contour. KNN, SVM and ANN classifier are used to classify benign breast mass and malignant mass.
Results:  The proposed method is tested on a set with 323 contours including 143 benign masses and 180 malignant ones from digital database of screening mammography (DDSM). The best accuracy of classification is 99.66\% using the feature of root mean square slope with SVM classifier.
Conclusion:  The performance of the proposed method is better than traditional method. In addition, RMS slope is an effective feature comparable to most of the existing features.},

The existing computer aided diagnosis (CAD) methods used to beneﬁt a lot from low-level or middle-level features which are not that good at the simulation of real diagnostic processes, adding difﬁculties in improving the classiﬁcation performance. In this paper, we design a deep feature based framework for breast mass classiﬁcation task. It mainly contains a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a decision mechanism. Combining intensity information and deep features automatically extracted by the trained CNN from the original image, our proposed method could better simulate the diagnostic procedure operated by doctors and achieved state-of-art performance. In this framework, doctors' global and local impressions left by mass images were represented by deep features extracted from two different layers called high-level and middle-level features. Meanwhile, the original images were regarded as detailed descriptions of the breast mass. Then, classiﬁers based on features above were used in combination to predict classes of test images. And outcomes of classiﬁers based on different features were analyzed jointly to determine the types of test images. With the help of two kinds of feature visualization methods, deep features extracted from different layers illustrate effective in classiﬁcation performance and diagnosis simulation. In addition, our method was applied to DDSM dataset and achieved high accuracy under two objective evaluation measures.},

	abstract = {The classiﬁcation of breast masses from mammograms into benign or malignant has been commonly addressed with machine learning classiﬁers that use as input a large set of hand-crafted features, usually based on general geometrical and texture information. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method that automatically learns features based directly on the optmisation of breast mass classiﬁcation from mammograms, where we target an improved classiﬁcation performance compared to the approach described above. The novelty of our approach lies in the two-step training process that involves a pre-training based on the learning of a regressor that estimates the values of a large set of handcrafted features, followed by a ﬁne-tuning stage that learns the breast mass classiﬁer. Using the publicly available INbreast dataset, we show that the proposed method produces better classiﬁcation results, compared with the machine learning model using hand-crafted features and with deep learning method trained directly for the classiﬁcation stage without the pre-training stage. We also show that the proposed method produces the current state-of-the-art breast mass classiﬁcation results for the INbreast dataset. Finally, we integrate the proposed classiﬁer into a fully automated breast mass detection and segmentation, which shows promising results.},

The processing of these layers involves sequential extraction of appearance features for an individual object, consistency measurement features for nearby objects, and ﬁnally the distribution features for all objects within the group. Using the concept of scope-based normalization, the extracted features not only enhance local contrast of an individual object, but also provide consistent characterization for all related objects. As an example, a microcalciﬁcation group detection system for 2D mammography was developed, and then the learned model was transferred to 3D digital breast tomosynthesis without any retraining or ﬁne-tuning. The detection system demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and detected 96\% of cancerous lesions at the rate of 1.2 false positives per volume as measured on an independent tomosynthesis test set.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Mammographic breast density is an established risk marker for breast cancer and is visually assessed by radiologists in routine mammogram image reading, using four qualitative Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System (BI-RADS) breast density categories. It is particularly difficult for radiologists to consistently distinguish the two most common and most variably assigned BIRADS categories, i.e., “scattered density” and “heterogeneously dense”. The aim of this work was to investigate a deep learning-based breast density classifier to consistently distinguish these two categories, aiming at providing a potential computerized tool to assist radiologists in assigning a BIRADS category in current clinical workflow.
Methods: In this study, we constructed a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model coupled with a large (i.e., 22,000 images) digital mammogram imaging dataset to evaluate the classification performance between the two aforementioned breast density categories. All images were collected from a cohort of 1,427 women who underwent standard digital mammography screening from 2005 to 2016 at our institution. The truths of the density categories were based on standard clinical assessment made by board-certified breast imaging radiologists. Effects of direct training from scratch solely using digital mammogram images and transfer learning of a pretrained model on a large nonmedical imaging dataset were evaluated for the specific task of breast density classification. In order to measure the classification performance, the CNN classifier was also tested on a refined version of the mammogram image dataset by removing some potentially inaccurately labeled images. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to measure the accuracy of the classifier.
Results: The AUC was 0.9421 when the CNN-model was trained from scratch on our own mammogram images, and the accuracy increased gradually along with an increased size of training samples. Using the pretrained model followed by a fine-tuning process with as few as 500 mammogram images led to an AUC of 0.9265. After removing the potentially inaccurately labeled images, AUC was increased to 0.9882 and 0.9857 for without and with the pretrained model, respectively, both significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.001) than when using the full imaging dataset.
Conclusions: Our study demonstrated high classification accuracies between two difficult to distinguish breast density categories that are routinely assessed by radiologists. We anticipate that our approach will help enhance current clinical assessment of breast density and better support consistent density notification to patients in breast cancer screening. © 2017 American Association of Physicists in Medicine [https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.12683]},

	abstract = {Background and objective: Radiologists often have a hard time classifying mammography mass lesions which leads to unnecessary breast biopsies to remove suspicions and this ends up adding exorbitant expenses to an already burdened patient and health care system.
Methods: In this paper we developed a Computer-aided Diagnosis (CAD) system based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that aims to help the radiologist classify mammography mass lesions. Deep learning usually requires large datasets to train networks of a certain depth from scratch. Transfer learning is an effective method to deal with relatively small datasets as in the case of medical images, although it can be tricky as we can easily start overﬁtting.
Results: In this work, we explore the importance of transfer learning and we experimentally determine the best ﬁne-tuning strategy to adopt when training a CNN model. We were able to successfully ﬁne-tune some of the recent, most powerful CNNs and achieved better results compared to other state-of-the-art methods which classiﬁed the same public datasets. For instance we achieved 97.35\% accuracy and 0.98 AUC on the DDSM database, 95.50\% accuracy and 0.97 AUC on the INbreast database and 96.67\% accuracy and 0.96 AUC on the BCDR database. Furthermore, after pre-processing and normalizing all the extracted Regions of Interest (ROIs) from the full mammograms, we merged all the datasets to build one large set of images and used it to ﬁne-tune our CNNs. The CNN model which achieved the best results, a 98.94\% accuracy, was used as a baseline to build the Breast Cancer Screening Framework. To evaluate the proposed CAD system and its eﬃciency to classify new images, we tested it on an independent database (MIAS) and got 98.23\% accuracy and 0.99 AUC.
Conclusion: The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed framework is performant and can indeed be used to predict if the mass lesions are benign or malignant. © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: The percentage of mammographic dense tissue (PD) is an important risk factor for breast cancer, and there is some evidence that texture features may further improve predictive ability. However, relatively little work has assessed or validated textural feature algorithms using raw full field digital mammograms (FFDM).
Method: A case-control study nested within a screening cohort (age 46–73 years) from Manchester UK was used to develop a texture feature risk score (264 cases diagnosed at the same time as mammogram of the contralateral breast, 787 controls) using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method for 112 features, and validated in a second case-control study from the same cohort but with cases diagnosed after the index mammogram (317 cases, 931 controls). Predictive ability was assessed using deviance and matched concordance index (mC). The ability to improve risk estimation beyond percent volumetric density (Volpara) was evaluated using conditional logistic regression.
Results: The strongest features identified in the training set were “sum average” based on the grey-level co-occurrence matrix at low image resolutions (original resolution 10.628 pixels per mm; downsized by factors of 16, 32 and 64), which had a better deviance and mC than volumetric PD. In the validation study, the risk score combining the three sum average features achieved a better deviance than volumetric PD (Δχ2 = 10.55 or 6.95 if logarithm PD) and a similar mC to volumetric PD (0.58 and 0.57, respectively). The risk score added independent information to volumetric PD (Δχ2 = 14.38, p = 0.0008).
Conclusion: Textural features based on digital mammograms improve risk assessment beyond volumetric percentage density. The features and risk score developed need further investigation in other settings.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07047},
	abstract = {Advances in deep learning for natural images have prompted a surge of interest in applying similar techniques to medical images. The majority of the initial attempts focused on replacing the input of a deep convolutional neural network with a medical image, which does not take into consideration the fundamental differences between these two types of images. Speciﬁcally, ﬁne details are necessary for detection in medical images, unlike in natural images where coarse structures matter most. This difference makes it inadequate to use the existing network architectures developed for natural images, because they work on heavily downscaled images to reduce the memory requirements. This hides details necessary to make accurate predictions. Additionally, a single exam in medical imaging often comes with a set of views which must be fused in order to reach a correct conclusion. In our work, we propose to use a multi-view deep convolutional neural network that handles a set of high-resolution medical images. We evaluate it on largescale mammography-based breast cancer screening (BI-RADS prediction) using 886,000 images. We focus on investigating the impact of the training set size and image size on the prediction accuracy. Our results highlight that performance increases with the size of training set, and that the best performance can only be achieved using the original resolution. In the reader study, performed on a random subset of the test set, we conﬁrmed the efﬁcacy of our model, which achieved performance comparable to a committee of radiologists when presented with the same data.},

	abstract = {Background and objective: Automatic detection and classiﬁcation of the masses in mammograms are still a big challenge and play a crucial role to assist radiologists for accurate diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system based on one of the regional deep learning techniques, a ROI-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is called You Only Look Once (YOLO). Although most previous studies only deal with classiﬁcation of masses, our proposed YOLO-based CAD system can handle detection and classiﬁcation simultaneously in one framework.
Methods: The proposed CAD system contains four main stages: preprocessing of mammograms, feature extraction utilizing deep convolutional networks, mass detection with conﬁdence, and ﬁnally mass classiﬁcation using Fully Connected Neural Networks (FC-NNs). In this study, we utilized original 600 mammograms from Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) and their augmented mammograms of 2,400 with the information of the masses and their types in training and testing our CAD. The trained YOLO-based CAD system detects the masses and then classiﬁes their types into benign or malignant.
Results: Our results with ﬁve-fold cross validation tests show that the proposed CAD system detects the mass location with an overall accuracy of 99.7\%. The system also distinguishes between benign and malignant lesions with an overall accuracy of 97\%.
Conclusions: Our proposed system even works on some challenging breast cancer cases where the masses exist over the pectoral muscles or dense regions.},

Our method eﬃciently segments diﬀerent types of tissues in breast biopsy images while simultaneously predicting a discriminative map for identifying important areas in an image. Our network, Y-Net, extends and generalizes U-Net by adding a parallel branch for discriminative map generation and by supporting convolutional block modularity, which allows the user to adjust network eﬃciency without altering the network topology. Y-Net delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy while learning 6.6× fewer parameters than its closest competitors. The addition of descriptive power from Y-Net’s discriminative segmentation masks improve diagnostic classiﬁcation accuracy by 7\% over state-of-the-art methods for diagnostic classiﬁcation.

Early researches have proved the diagnostic value of the calcification, yet their performance is highly dependent on handcrafted image descriptors. Characterizing the calcification mammography in an automatic and robust way remains a challenge. In this paper, the calcification was characterized by descriptors obtained from deep learning and handcrafted descriptors. We compared the performances of different image feature sets on digital mammograms. The feature sets included the deep features alone, the handcrafted features, their combination, and the filtered deep features. Experimental results have demonstrated that the deep features outperform handcrafted features, but the handcrafted features can provide complementary information for deep features. We achieved a classification precision of 89.32\% and sensitivity of 86.89\% using the filtered deep features, which is the best performance among all the feature sets.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To investigate two deep learning-based modeling schemes for predicting short-term risk of developing breast cancer using prior normal screening digital mammograms in a case-control setting.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective Institutional Review Board-approved study on a case-control cohort of 226 patients (including 113 women diagnosed with breast cancer and 113 controls) who underwent general population breast cancer screening. For each patient, a prior normal (i.e., with negative or benign findings) digital mammogram examination [including mediolateral oblique (MLO) view and craniocaudal (CC) view two images] was collected. Thus, a total of 452 normal images (226 MLO view images and 226 CC view images) of this case-control cohort were analyzed to predict the outcome, i.e., developing breast cancer (cancer cases) or remaining breast cancer-free (controls) within the follow-up period. We implemented an end-to-end deep learning model and a GoogLeNet-LDA model and compared their effects in several experimental settings using two mammographic view images and inputting two different subregions of the images to the models. The proposed models were also compared to logistic regression modeling of mammographic breast density. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used as the model performance metric.
Results: The highest AUC was 0.73 [95\% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.68–0.78; GoogLeNet-LDA model on CC view] when using the whole-breast and was 0.72 (95\% CI: 0.67–0.76; GoogLeNetLDA model on MLO + CC view) when using the dense tissue, respectively, as the model input. The GoogleNet-LDA model significantly (all P {\textless} 0.05) outperformed the end-to-end GoogLeNet model in all experiments. CC view was consistently more predictive than MLO view in both deep learning models, regardless of the input subregions. Both models exhibited superior performance than the percent breast density (AUC = 0.54; 95\% CI: 0.49–0.59).
Conclusions: The proposed deep learning modeling approach can predict short-term breast cancer risk using normal screening mammogram images. Larger studies are needed to further reveal the promise of deep learning in enhancing imaging-based breast cancer risk assessment. © 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine [https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.13886]},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the malignant tumor that causes the highest number of cancer deaths in females. Digital mammograms (DM or 2D mammogram) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT or 3D mammogram) are the two types of mammography imagery that are used in clinical practice for breast cancer detection and diagnosis. Radiologists usually read both imaging modalities in combination; however, existing computer-aided diagnosis tools are designed using only one imaging modality. Inspired by clinical practice, we propose an innovative convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for breast cancer classiﬁcation, which uses both 2D and 3D mammograms, simultaneously. Our experiment shows that the proposed method signiﬁcantly improves the performance of breast cancer classiﬁcation. By assembling three CNN classiﬁers, the proposed model achieves 0.97 AUC, which is 34.72\% higher than the methods using only one imaging modality.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed solid cancers. Mammography is the most commonly used screening technology for detecting breast cancer. Traditional machine learning methods of mammographic image classiﬁcation or segmentation using manual features require a great quantity of manual segmentation annotation data to train the model and test the results. But manual labeling is expensive, time-consuming, and laborious, and greatly increases the cost of system construction. To reduce this cost and the workload of radiologists, an end-to-end full-image mammogram classiﬁcation method based on deep neural networks was proposed for classiﬁer building, which can be constructed without bounding boxes or mask ground truth label of training data. The only label required in this method is the classiﬁcation of mammographic images, which can be relatively easy to collect from diagnostic reports. Because breast lesions usually take up a fraction of the total area visualized in the mammographic image, we propose different pooling structures for convolutional neural networks(CNNs) instead of the common pooling methods, which divide the image into regions and select the few with high probability of malignancy as the representation of the whole mammographic image. The proposed pooling structures can be applied on most CNN-based models, which may greatly improve the models’ performance on mammographic image data with the same input. Experimental results on the publicly available INbreast dataset and CBIS dataset indicate that the proposed pooling structures perform satisfactorily on mammographic image data compared with previous stateof-the-art mammographic image classiﬁers and detection algorithm using segmentation annotations.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the second deadliest cancer among women. Mammography is an important method for physicians to diagnose breast cancer. The main purpose of this study is to use deep learning to automatically classify breast masses in mammograms into benign and malignant. This study proposes a two-view mammograms classiﬁcation model consisting of convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN), which is used to classify benign and malignant breast masses. The model is composed of two branch networks, and two modiﬁed ResNet are used to extract breast-mass features of mammograms from craniocaudal (CC) view and mediolateral oblique (MLO) view, respectively. In order to effectively utilise the spatial relationship of the two-view mammograms, gate recurrent unit (GRU) structures of RNN is used to fuse the features of the breast mass from the two-view. The digital database for screening mammography (DDSM) be used for training and testing our model. The experimental results show that the classiﬁcation accuracy, recall and area under curve (AUC) of our method reach 0.947, 0.941 and 0.968, respectively. Compared with previous studies, our method has signiﬁcantly improved the performance of benign and malignant classiﬁcation.},

	abstract = {The diagnosis of breast cancer in early stage is essential for successful treatment. Detection can be performed in several ways, the most common being through mammograms. The projections acquired by this type of examination are directly affected by the composition of the breast, which density can be similar to the suspicious masses, being a challenge the identification of malignant lesions. In this article, we propose a computer-aided detection (CAD) system to aid in the diagnosis of masses in digitized mammograms using a model based in the U-Net, allowing specialists to monitor the lesion over time. Unlike most of the studies, we propose the use of an entire base of digitized mammograms using normal, benign, and malignant cases. Our research is divided into four stages: (1) pre-processing, with the removal of irrelevant information, enhancement of the contrast of 7989 images of the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM), and obtaining regions of interest. (2) Data augmentation, with horizontal mirroring, zooming, and resizing of images; (3) training, with tests of six-based U-Net models, with different characteristics; (4) testing, evaluating four metrics, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Dice Index. The tested models obtained different results regarding the assessed parameters. The best model achieved a sensitivity of 92.32\%, specificity of 80.47\%, accuracy of 85.95\% Dice Index of 79.39\%, and AUC of 86.40\%. Even using a full base without case selection bias, the results obtained demonstrate that the use of a complete database can provide knowledge to the CAD expert.},

Early detection of breast cancer, followed by appropriate treatment, can reduce the risk of death from this disease. DL through CNN can assist imaging specialists in classifying the mammograms accurately. Accurate classification of mammograms using CNN needs a well-trained CNN by a large number of labeled mammograms. Unfortunately, a large number of labeled mammograms are not always available. In this study, a novel procedure to aid imaging specialists in detecting normal and abnormal mammograms has been proposed. The procedure supplied the designed CNN with a cheat sheet for some classical attributes extracted from the ROI and an extra number of labeled mammograms through data augmentation. The cheat sheet aided the CNN through encoding easy-to-recognize artificial patterns in the mammogram before passing it to the CNN, and the data augmentation supported the CNN with more labeled data points. Fifteen runs of 4 different modified datasets taken from the MIAS dataset were conducted and analyzed. The results showed that the cheat sheet, along with data augmentation, enhanced CNN’s accuracy by at least 12.2\% and enhanced the precision of the CNN by at least 2.2. The mean accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity obtained using the proposed procedure were 92.1, 91.4, and 96.8, respectively, while the average area under the ROC curve was 94.9.},

	abstract = {Data scarcity and class imbalance are two fundamental challenges in many machine learning applications to healthcare. Breast cancer classiﬁcation in mammography exempliﬁes these challenges, with a malignancy rate of around 0.5\% in a screening population, which is compounded by the relatively small size of lesions (∼1\% of the image) in malignant cases. Simultaneously, the prevalence of screening mammography creates a potential abundance of non-cancer exams to use for training. Altogether, these characteristics lead to overﬁtting on cancer cases, while under-utilizing non-cancer data. Here, we present a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) model for data augmentation that can realistically synthesize and remove lesions on mammograms. With self-attention and semi-supervised learning components, the U-net-based architecture can generate high resolution (256x256px) outputs, as necessary for mammography. When augmenting the original training set with the GAN-generated samples, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant improvement in malignancy classiﬁcation performance on a test set of real mammogram patches. Overall, the empirical results of our algorithm and the relevance to other medical imaging paradigms point to potentially fruitful further applications.},

            We aimed to predict molecular subtypes of breast cancer using radiomics signatures extracted from synthetic mammography reconstructed from digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). A total of 365 patients with invasive breast cancer with three different molecular subtypes (luminal A + B, luminal; HER2-positive, HER2; triple-negative, TN) were assigned to the training set and temporally independent validation cohort. A total of 129 radiomics features were extracted from synthetic mammograms. The radiomics signature was built using the elastic-net approach. Clinical features included patient age, lesion size and image features assessed by radiologists. In the validation cohort, the radiomics signature yielded an AUC of 0.838, 0.556, and 0.645 for the TN, HER2 and luminal subtypes, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, the radiomics signature was the only independent predictor of the molecular subtype. The combination of the radiomics signature and clinical features showed significantly higher AUC values than clinical features only for distinguishing the TN subtype. In conclusion, the radiomics signature showed high performance for distinguishing TN breast cancer. Radiomics signatures may serve as biomarkers for TN breast cancer and may help to determine the direction of treatment for these patients.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Breast mass segmentation is a prerequisite step in the use of computer-aided tools designed for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. However, mass segmentation remains challenging due to the low contrast, irregular shapes, and fuzzy boundaries of masses. In this work, we propose a mammography mass segmentation model for improving segmentation performance.
Methods: We propose a mammography mass segmentation model called SAP-cGAN, which is based on an improved conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). We introduce a superpixel average pooling layer into the cGAN decoder, which utilizes superpixels as a pooling layout to improve boundary segmentation. In addition, we adopt a multiscale input strategy to enable the network to learn scale-invariant features with increased robustness. The performance of the model is evaluated with two public datasets: CBIS-DDSM and INbreast. Moreover, ablation analysis is conducted to evaluate further the individual contribution of each block to the performance of the network.
Results: Dice and Jaccard scores of 93.37\% and 87.57\%, respectively, are obtained for the CBISDDSM dataset. The Dice and Jaccard scores for the INbreast dataset are 91.54\% and 84.40\%, respectively. These results indicate that our proposed model outperforms current state-of-the-art breast mass segmentation methods. The superpixel average pooling layer and multiscale input strategy has improved the Dice and Jaccard scores of the original cGAN by 7.8\% and 12.79\%, respectively.
Conclusions: Adversarial learning with the addition of a superpixel average pooling layer and multiscale input strategy can encourage the Generator network to generate masks with increased realism and improve breast mass segmentation performance through the minimax game between the Generator network and Discriminator network. © 2020 American Association of Physicists in Medicine [https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.14671]},

Computer-aided detection (CAD) systems, deep learning (DL) in particular, have continued to provide significant computa­ tional solution in early detection and diagnosis of this disease. Research efforts are advancing novel approaches to improve the performance of DL-based models. Techniques such as data augmentation, varying depth of model, image quality enhancement, and choice of classifier have been proposed to improve performance in the char­ acterization of abnormalities in mammograms. However, no significant progress has been made in applying deep learning techniques to the detection of architectural distortion – a form of abnormalities in breast images. In this research, we propose a novel convolution neural network (CNN) model for the detection of architectural distortion by enhancing its performance using data augmentation technique. We also investigate the performance of the proposed model on different operations of image augmentation. Furthermore, the new model was adapted to detect images presenting the right and left breast presented in MLO and CC views. Similarly, we investigate the performance of our model under the fixed-size region of interests (ROIs) and multi-size whole images inputs. Our method was trained on 5136 ROIs from MIAS, 410 whole images from INbreast, 322 whole images from MIAS, and 55,890 ROIs from DDSM + CBS databases. Performance evaluation of the proposed model in comparison with other state-of-the-art techniques revealed that the model achieved 93.75 \% accuracy. This study has, therefore, strengthened the need to leverage data augmentation techniques to enhance the detection of archi­ tectural distortion, thereby reducing the rate of advanced cases of breast cancer.},

            Breast cancer analysis implies that radiologists inspect mammograms to detect suspicious breast lesions and identify mass tumors. Artificial intelligence techniques offer automatic systems for breast mass segmentation to assist radiologists in their diagnosis. With the rapid development of deep learning and its application to medical imaging challenges, UNet and its variations is one of the state-of-the-art models for medical image segmentation that showed promising performance on mammography. In this paper, we propose an architecture, called Connected-UNets, which connects two UNets using additional modified skip connections. We integrate Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) in the two standard UNets to emphasize the contextual information within the encoder–decoder network architecture. We also apply the proposed architecture on the Attention UNet (AUNet) and the Residual UNet (ResUNet). We evaluated the proposed architectures on two publically available datasets, the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM) and INbreast, and additionally on a private dataset. Experiments were also conducted using additional synthetic data using the cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) model between two unpaired datasets to augment and enhance the images. Qualitative and quantitative results show that the proposed architecture can achieve better automatic mass segmentation with a high Dice score of 89.52\%, 95.28\%, and 95.88\% and Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 80.02\%, 91.03\%, and 92.27\%, respectively, on CBIS-DDSM, INbreast, and the private dataset.},

Based on the existing deep learning methods, focusing on the diversity of breast cancer lesion types, this paper proposes a computer-aided diagnosis system based on YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) convolutional neural network for mammograms. In this system, we integrate detection and multi-classification problems of breast lesions into a regression problem, thereby simultaneously accomplish the two tasks in one framework. The proposed computer-aided diagnosis system is mainly divided into three components: preprocessing part of the original mammograms, deep convolutional neural network based on YOLOv3, processing and evaluation of the network output. We use the dataset from CBIS-DDSM to train three models: general model, mass model and microcalcification model. These trained models can detect the position of the input mammograms in different situations, and then classify them into mass, microcalcification, benign, malignant, and other categories. After evaluating the performance by using test set images, the accuracy rates of the general model, mass model, and microcalcification model trained by our system reach 93.667 \%, 97.767 \%, 96.870 \% in the detection task, and 93.927 \%, 98.121 \%, 97.045 \% in the classification task.

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end system, which is based on You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) model, to simultaneously localize and classify suspicious breast lesions from entire mammograms. The proposed system first preprocesses the raw images, then recognizes abnormal regions as breast lesions and determines their pathology classification as either mass or calcification. We evaluated the model on two publicly available datasets, with 2907 mammograms from the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM) and 235 mammograms from INbreast database. We also used a privately collected dataset with 487 mammograms. Furthermore, we suggested a fusion models approach to report more precise detection and accurate classification. Our best results reached a detection accuracy rate of 95.7\%, 98.1\% and 98\% for mass lesions and 74.4\%, 71.8\% and 73.2\% for calcification lesions, respectively on CBIS-DDSM, INbreast and the private dataset.},

	abstract = {UNet adopting an encoder-decoder structure has been used widely in medical image segmentation tasks for its outstanding performance. However, in our work, we find that UNet has the worse segmentation performance of small masses. The reason behind this is that the sizes of receptive fields are limited. In this work, to address this issue, we develop a novel end-to-end model, Adaptive Receptive Field Network (ARF-Net), for the precise breast mass segmentation in whole mammographic images and ultrasound images. ARF-Net composes of an encoder network and a corresponding decoder network, followed by a pixel-wise classifier. In ARF-Net, a Selective Receptive Filed Module (SRFM) is proposed to allocate the suitable sizes of receptive fields to the breast masses of different sizes. SRFM consists of a Multiple Receptive Field Module (MRFM) for generating multiple receptive fields of different sizes and a Multi-Scale Selection Module (MSSM) for selecting the suitable sizes of receptive fields based on the objects’ size. The proposed ARF-Net achieves the dice index of 86.1\%, 85.75\%, and 88.12\% on the two mammographic databases (INbreast and CBIS-DDSM) and one ultrasonic database (UDIAT), respectively. Moreover, extensive ablation experiments show that ARF-Net transcends several state-of-the-art segmentation networks, and the developed MSSM exceeds several counterparts.},

	abstract = {Background and objective: Both mass detection and segmentation in digital mammograms play a crucial role in early breast cancer detection and treatment. Furthermore, clinical experience has shown that they are the upstream tasks of pathological classiﬁcation of breast lesions. Recent advancements in deep learning have made the analyses faster and more accurate. This study aims to develop a deep learning model architecture for breast cancer mass detection and segmentation using the mammography.
Methods: In this work we proposed a double shot model for mass detection and segmentation simultaneously using a combination of YOLO (You Only Look Once) and LOGO (Local-Global) architectures. Firstly, we adopted YoloV5L6, the state-of-the-art object detection model, to position and crop the breast mass in mammograms with a high resolution; Secondly, to balance training eﬃciency and segmentation performance, we modiﬁed the LOGO training strategy to train the whole images and cropped images on the global and local transformer branches separately. The two branches were then merged to form the ﬁnal segmentation decision.
Results: The proposed YOLO-LOGO model was tested on two independent mammography datasets (CBISDDSM and INBreast). The proposed model performs signiﬁcantly better than previous works. It achieves true positive rate 95.7\% and mean average precision 65.0\% for mass detection on CBIS-DDSM dataset. Its performance for mass segmentation on CBIS-DDSM dataset is F1-score=74.5\% and IoU=64.0\%. The similar performance trend is observed in another independent dataset INBreast as well.
Conclusions: The proposed model has a higher eﬃciency and better performance, reduces computational requirements, and improves the versatility and accuracy of computer-aided breast cancer diagnosis. Hence it has the potential to enable more assistance for doctors in early breast cancer detection and treatment, thereby reducing mortality.},

	abstract = {Background and Objective: Computer-aided-detection (CAD) systems have been developed to assist radiologists on ﬁnding suspicious lesions in mammogram. Deep Learning technology have recently succeeded to increase the chance of recognizing abnormality at an early stage in order to avoid unnecessary biopsies and decrease the mortality rate. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of an end-to-end fusion model based on You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) architecture, to simultaneously detect and classify suspicious breast lesions on digital mammograms. Four categories of cases were included: Mass, Calciﬁcation, Architectural Distortions, and Normal from a private digital mammographic database including 413 cases. For all cases, Prior mammograms (typically scanned 1 year before) were all reported as Normal, while Current mammograms were diagnosed as cancerous (conﬁrmed by biopsies) or healthy.
Methods: We propose to apply the YOLO-based fusion model to the Current mammograms for breast lesions detection and classiﬁcation. Then apply the same model retrospectively to synthetic mammograms for an early cancer prediction, where the synthetic mammograms were generated from the Prior mammograms by using the image-to-image translation models, CycleGAN and Pix2Pix.
Results: Evaluation results showed that our methodology could signiﬁcantly detect and classify breast lesions on Current mammograms with a highest rate of 93\% ± 0.118 for Mass lesions, 88\% ± 0.09 for Calciﬁcation lesions, and 95\% ± 0.06 for Architectural Distortion lesions. In addition, we reported evaluation results on Prior mammograms with a highest rate of 36\% ± 0.01 for Mass lesions, 14\% ± 0.01 for Calciﬁcation lesions, and 50\% ± 0.02 for Architectural Distortion lesions. Normal mammograms were accordingly classiﬁed with an accuracy rate of 92\% ± 0.09 and 90\% ± 0.06 respectively on Current and Prior exams.
Conclusions: Our proposed framework was ﬁrst developed to help detecting and identifying suspicious breast lesions in X-ray mammograms on their Current screening. The work was also suggested to reduce the temporal changes between pairs of Prior and follow-up screenings for early predicting the location and type of abnormalities in Prior mammogram screening. The paper presented a CAD method to assist doctors and experts to identify the risk of breast cancer presence. Overall, the proposed CAD method incorporates the advances of image processing, deep learning and image-to-image translation for a biomedical application.},

            A computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system requires automated stages of tumor detection, segmentation, and classification that are integrated sequentially into one framework to assist the radiologists with a final diagnosis decision. In this paper, we introduce the final step of breast mass classification and diagnosis using a stacked ensemble of residual neural network (ResNet) models (i.e. ResNet50V2, ResNet101V2, and ResNet152V2). The work presents the task of classifying the detected and segmented breast masses into malignant or benign, and diagnosing the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment category with a score from 2 to 6 and the shape as oval, round, lobulated, or irregular. The proposed methodology was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM) and INbreast, and additionally on a private dataset. Comparative experiments were conducted on the individual models and an average ensemble of models with an XGBoost classifier. Qualitative and quantitative results show that the proposed model achieved better performance for (1) Pathology classification with an accuracy of 95.13\%, 99.20\%, and 95.88\%; (2) BI-RADS category classification with an accuracy of 85.38\%, 99\%, and 96.08\% respectively on CBIS-DDSM, INbreast, and the private dataset; and (3) shape classification with 90.02\% on the CBIS-DDSM dataset. Our results demonstrate that our proposed integrated framework could benefit from all automated stages to outperform the latest deep learning methodologies.},

We developed a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to simulate a mammogram with normal appearance using the opposite mammogram as the condition. We used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on Radon Cumulative Distribution Transform (RCDT) processed mammograms to detect MO cancer. For training CGAN, we used screening mammograms of 1366 women. For MO cancer detection, we used screening mammograms of 333 women (97 MO cancer) with dense breasts. We simulated the right mammogram for normal controls and the cancer side for MO cancer cases. We created two RCDT images, one from a real mammogram pair and another from a real-simulated mammogram pair. We ﬁnetuned a VGG16 on resulting RCDT images to classify the women with MO cancer. We compared the classiﬁcation performance of the CNN trained on fused RCDT images, CNNFused to that of trained only on real RCDT images, CNNReal, and to that of trained only on simulated RCDT images, CNNSimulated. The test AUC for CNNFused was 0.77 with a 95\% conﬁdence interval (95CI) of [0.71, 0.83], which was statistically better (p-value {\textless} 0.02) than the CNNReal AUC of 0.70 with a 95CI of [0.64, 0.77] and CNNSimulated AUC of 0.68 with a 95CI of [0.62, 0.75].

	abstract = {Traditionally, deep learning-based methods for breast cancer classiﬁcation perform a single-view analysis. However, radiologists simultaneously analyze all four views that compose a mammography exam, owing to the correlations contained in mammography views, which present crucial information for identifying tumors. In light of this, some studies have started to propose multi-view methods. Nevertheless, in such existing architectures, mammogram views are processed as independent images by separate convolutional branches, thus losing correlations among them. To overcome such limitations, in this paper we propose a novel approach for multi-view breast cancer classiﬁcation based on parameterized hypercomplex neural networks. Thanks to hypercomplex algebra properties, our networks are able to model, and thus leverage, existing correlations between the different views that comprise a mammogram exam, thus mimicking the reading process performed by clinicians. As a consequence, the proposed method is able to handle the information of a patient altogether without breaking the multi-view nature of the exam. Starting from the proposed hypercomplex approach, we deﬁne architectures designed to process two-view exams, namely PHResNets, and four-view exams, i.e., PHYSEnet and PHYSBOnet, with the ability to grasp inter-view correlations in a wide range of clinical use cases. Through an extensive experimental evaluation conducted with two publicly available datasets, CBIS-DDSM and INbreast, we demonstrate that our parameterized hypercomplex models clearly outperform realvalued counterparts and also state-of-the-art methods, proving that breast cancer classiﬁcation beneﬁts from the proposed multi-view architecture.

	abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in various medical imaging tasks. However, due to the intrinsic locality of convolution operations, CNNs generally cannot model long-range dependencies well, which are important for accurately identifying or mapping corresponding breast lesion features computed from unregistered multiple mammograms. This motivated us to leverage the architecture of Multi-view Vision Transformers to capture longrange relationships of multiple mammograms from the same patient in one examination. For this purpose, we employed local transformer blocks to separately learn patch relationships within four mammograms acquired from two-view (CC/MLO) of two-side (right/left) breasts. The outputs from different views and sides were concatenated and fed into global transformer blocks, to jointly learn patch relationships between four images representing two different views of the left and right breasts. To evaluate the proposed model, we retrospectively assembled a dataset involving 949 sets of mammograms, which included 470 malignant cases and 479 normal or benign cases. We trained and evaluated the model using a ﬁve-fold cross-validation method. Without any arduous preprocessing steps (e.g., optimal window cropping, chest wall or pectoral muscle removal, two-view image registration, etc.), our four-image (two-view-two-side) transformer-based model achieves case classiﬁcation performance with an area under ROC curve (AUC = 0.818 ± 0.039), which signiﬁcantly outperforms AUC = 0.784 ± 0.016 achieved by the state-of-the-art multi-view CNNs (p = 0.009). It also outperforms two one-view-two-side models that achieve AUC of 0.724 ± 0.013 (CC view) and 0.769 ± 0.036 (MLO view), respectively. The study demonstrates the potential of using transformers to develop high-performing computer-aided diagnosis schemes that combine four mammograms.},

	abstract = {Background: Nowadays, breast cancer is the second cause of death after cardiovascular diseases. In general, about one out of eight women (about 12\%) suffer from this disease during their life in the USA and European countries. If breast cancer is detected at an early stage, its survival rate will be very high. Several methods have been introduced to diagnose breast cancer with their clinical advantages and disadvantages. Main text: In this review, various methods of breast imaging have been introduced. Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of each of these methods have been investigated. For each of the imaging methods, articles that were relevant to the past 10 years were selected through electronic search engines, and then the most relevant papers were selected. Finally, about 40 articles were studied and their results were categorized and presented in the form of a report as follows. Various breast cancer imaging techniques were extracted as follows: mammography, contrast-enhanced mammography, digital tomosynthesis, sonography, sonoelastography, magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic elastography, diffusion-weighted imaging, magnetic spectroscopy, nuclear medicine, optical imaging, and microwave imaging. Conclusion: The choice of these methods depends on the patient’s state and stage, the age of the individual and the density of the breast tissue. Hybrid imaging techniques appear to be an acceptable way to improve detection of breast cancer. This review article can be useful in choosing the right method for imaging in people suspected of breast cancer.},

The typical periods of cancer development are during puberty, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. Thermography can be utilized for breast analysis, and provides useful data on the location of hyperthermia and the vascular state of the tissue. Computer-aided diagnosis is an algorithmic approach which can be assistive during routine screening, so that human error in breast analysis for cancer detection is reduced. In early-stage cancer, the accuracy of the assessment then increases, enabling clinicians to make an improved diagnosis of benign versus malignant classification. Herein, we have reviewed thermogram-based computer-aided diagnostic systems developed during the last two decades for breast cancer screening and analysis. We explore the quantitative and qualitative performances of machine learning based approaches, which include segmentation based and feature extraction based methods, dimensionality reduction, and various classification schemes, as proposed in the literature. We also describe the limitations, as well as future requirements to improve current techniques, which can help researchers and clinicians to be apprised of quantitative developments and to plan for the future.},

Works on this subject presented results that justify the thermography as a complementary exam to detect breast diseases. Several papers on the use of infrared imaging for breast screening can be found in the current medical literature. This survey explores and analyses these works in the light of their applications in computer vision. Consequently, the comments are organized according to the main steps of pattern recognition systems. These include: image acquisition protocols, exams storage, segmentation methods, feature extraction, classiﬁcation or diagnostic and computer modelling.

	abstract = {Developing a breast cancer screening method is very important to facilitate early breast cancer detection and treatment. Building a screening method using medical imaging modality that does not cause body tissue damage (non-invasive) and does not involve physical touch is challenging. Thermography, a non-invasive and non-contact cancer screening method, can detect tumors at an early stage even under precancerous conditions by observing temperature distribution in both breasts. The thermograms obtained on thermography can be interpreted using deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs can automatically classify breast thermograms into categories such as normal and abnormal. Despite their demostrated utility, CNNs have not been widely used in breast thermogram classiﬁcation. In this study, we aimed to summarize the current work and progress in breast cancer detection based on thermography and CNNs. We ﬁrst discuss of breast thermography potential in early breast cancer detection, providing an overview of the availability of breast thermal datasets together with publicly accessible. We also discuss characteristics of breast thermograms and the differences between healthy and cancerous thermographic patterns. Breast thermogram classiﬁcation using a CNN model is described step by step including a simulation example illustrating feature learning. We cover most research related to the implementation of deep neural networks for breast thermogram classiﬁcation and propose future research directions for developing representative datasets, feeding the segmented image, assigning a good kernel, and building a lightweight CNN model to improve CNN performance.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Develop a computer-aided detection (CAD) system for masses in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) volume using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with transfer learning from mammograms.
Methods: A data set containing 2282 digitized film and digital mammograms and 324 DBT volumes were collected with IRB approval. The mass of interest on the images was marked by an experienced breast radiologist as reference standard. The data set was partitioned into a training set (2282 mammograms with 2461 masses and 230 DBT views with 228 masses) and an independent test set (94 DBT views with 89 masses). For DCNN training, the region of interest (ROI) containing the mass (true positive) was extracted from each image. False positive (FP) ROIs were identified at prescreening by their previously developed CAD systems. After data augmentation, a total of 45 072 mammographic ROIs and 37 450 DBT ROIs were obtained. Data normalization and reduction of non-uniformity in the ROIs across heterogeneous data was achieved using a background correction method applied to each ROI. A DCNN with four convolutional layers and three fully connected (FC) layers was first trained on the mammography data. Jittering and dropout techniques were used to reduce overfitting. After training with the mammographic ROIs, all weights in the first three convolutional layers were frozen, and only the last convolution layer and the FC layers were randomly initialized again and trained using the DBT training ROIs. The authors compared the performances of two CAD systems for mass detection in DBT: one used the DCNN-based approach and the other used their previously developed feature-based approach for FP reduction. The prescreening stage was identical in both systems, passing the same set of mass candidates to the FP reduction stage. For the feature-based CAD system, 3D clustering and active contour method was used for segmentation; morphological, gray level, and texture features were extracted and merged with a linear discriminant classifier to score the detected masses. For the DCNN-based CAD system, ROIs from five consecutive slices centered at each candidate were passed through the trained DCNN and a mass likelihood score was generated. The performances of the CAD systems were evaluated using free-response ROC curves and the performance difference was analyzed using a non-parametric method.
Results: Before transfer learning, the DCNN trained only on mammograms with an AUC of 0.99 classified DBT masses with an AUC of 0.81 in the DBT training set. After transfer learning with DBT, the AUC improved to 0.90. For breast-based CAD detection in the test set, the sensitivity for the feature-based and the DCNN-based CAD systems was 83\% and 91\%, respectively, at 1 FP/DBT volume. The difference between the performances for the two systems was statistically significant (p-value {\textless} 0.05).
Conclusions: The image patterns learned from the mammograms were transferred to the mass detection on DBT slices through the DCNN. This study demonstrated that large data sets collected from mammography are useful for developing new CAD systems for DBT, alleviating the problem and effort of collecting entirely new large data sets for the new modality.

Mammography is one of the few screening modalities available to the modern world that has proved itself of much use by aiding early detection and treatment of nonpalpable, node-negative breast cancers. However, due to its two-dimensional nature, many cases of malignancies are still missed, to be detected at a later date or by an alternate modality. In 2011, FDA approved the supplemental use of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in screening and diagnostic set ups. The acquisition of multiple low-dose projection images of the compressed parenchyma provided a ‘third’ dimension to the mammogram whereby the breast tissue could be seen layer by layer on the workstation. It improves cancer detection rate, and reduces recall rate and false-positive findings by improving lesion characterization. The current review discusses the principle of DBT with a comprehensive study of the literature.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new method for bilateral asymmetry analysis of breast MR images that uses directional statistics of the breast parenchymal edges, obtained from a multiresolution local energy edge detector, and image texture information derived from local energy maps, obtained by using a bank of log-Gabor ﬁlters. Classiﬁcation of MRI scans into cancer and non-cancer categories was performed by linear discriminant analysis and the leave-oneout methodology. A total of 40 cases, 20 normal/benign (BI-RADS 1 and 2) and 20 malignant, taken from a high risk screening population, were used in this pilot study. Average classiﬁcation accuracy of 70\% (κ = 0.45 ± 0.14) with sensitivity and speciﬁcity of 75\% and 65\%, respectively, was achieved. The results obtained support the idea that bilateral asymmetry analysis of breast MR images can provide additional information for detection of breast tissue changes arising from diseases.},

	abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are a set of techniques that exploit large and/or complex real-world datasets for cross-domain and cross-discipline prediction and classification tasks. DL architectures excel in computer vision tasks, and in particular image processing and interpretation. This has prompted a wave of disruptingly innovative applications in medical imaging, where DL strategies have the potential to vastly outperform human experts. This is particularly relevant in the context of histopathology, where whole slide imaging (WSI) of stained tissue in conjuction with DL algorithms for their interpretation, selection and cancer staging are beginning to play an ever increasing role in supporting human operators in visual assessments. This has the potential to reduce everyday workload as well as to increase precision and reproducibility across observers, centers, staining techniques and even pathologies. In this paper we introduce the most common DL architectures used in image analysis, with a focus on histopathological image analysis in general and in breast histology in particular. We briefly review how, state-of-art DL architectures compare to human performance on across a number of critical tasks such as mitotic count, tubules analysis and nuclear pleomorphism analysis. Also, the development of DL algorithms specialized to pathology images have been enormously fueled by a number of world-wide challenges based on large, mul­ ticentric image databases which are now publicly available. In turn, this has allowed most recent efforts to shift more and more towards semi-supervised learning methods, which provide greater flexibility and applicability. We also review all major repositories of manually labelled pathology images in breast cancer and provide an indepth discussion of the challenges specific to training DL architectures to interpret WSI data, as well as a review of the state-of-the-art methods for interpretation of images generated from immunohistochemical analysis of breast lesions. We finally discuss the future challenges and opportunities which the adoption of DL paradigms is most likely to pose in the field of pathology for breast cancer detection, diagnosis, staging and prognosis. This review is intended as a comprehensive stepping stone into the field of modern computational pathology for a transdisciplinary readership across technical and medical disciplines.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Breast cancer, one of the most common health threats to females worldwide, has always been a crucial topic in the medical field. With the rapid development of digital pathology, many scholars have used AI-based systems to classify breast cancer pathological images. However, most existing studies only stayed on the binary classification of breast lesions (normal vs tumor or benign vs malignant), far from meeting the clinical demand. Therefore, we established a multi-class classification system of breast digital pathology images based on AI, which is more clinically practical than the binary classification system.
Methods: In this paper, we adopted a two-stage architecture based on deep learning method and machine learning method for the multi-class classification (normal tissue, benign lesion, ductal carcinoma in situ, and invasive carcinoma) of breast digital pathological images.
Results: The proposed approach achieved an overall accuracy of 86.67\% at patch-level. At WSI-level, the overall accuracies of our classification system were 88.16\% on validation data and 90.43\% on test data. Additionally, we used two public datasets, the BreakHis and BACH, for independent verification. The accuracies our model obtained on these two datasets were comparable to related publications. Furthermore, our model could achieve accuracies of 85.19\% on multi-classification and 96.30\% on binary classification (nonmalignant vs malignant) using pathology images of frozen sections, which was proven to have good generalizability. Then, we used t-SNE for visualization of patch classification efficiency. Finally, we analyzed morphological characteristics of patches learned by the model.
Conclusion: The proposed two-stage model could be effectively applied to the multi-class classification task of breast pathology images and could be a very useful tool for assisting pathologists in diagnosing breast cancer.},

Conventional screening methods include mammography and ultrasonography; however, both modalities have their limitations. Automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) is a recent technological advancement in the field of breast imaging having the benefit of standardization of the scans and lack of operator dependence as in conventional handheld ultrasound scans. The aim of this work was to report our initial experience of the added value of ABUS as a breast screening tool. The study included 200 patients who had screening mammograms, ultrasound, and ABUS.
Results: A significant difference was found between the number of lesions detected by ABUS and conventional ultrasound. A significant difference was found between lesions detected by ABUS and mammography which was most evident in patients with dense breasts.
Conclusions: ABUS is a valuable tool in the screening of the breast with improved lesion detection, especially in patients with dense breasts.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer in women is the second most common cancer worldwide. Early detection of breast cancer can reduce the risk of human life. Non-invasive techniques such as mammograms and ultrasound imaging are popularly used to detect the tumour. However, histopathological analysis is necessary to determine the malignancy of the tumour as it analyses the image at the cellular level. Manual analysis of these slides is time consuming, tedious, subjective and are susceptible to human errors. Also, at times the interpretation of these images are inconsistent between laboratories. Hence, a Computer-Aided Diagnostic system that can act as a decision support system is need of the hour. Moreover, recent developments in computational power and memory capacity led to the application of computer tools and medical image processing techniques to process and analyze breast cancer histopathological images. This review paper summarizes various traditional and deep learning based methods developed to analyze breast cancer histopathological images. Initially, the characteristics of breast cancer histopathological images are discussed. A detailed discussion on the various potential regions of interest is presented which is crucial for the development of Computer-Aided Diagnostic systems. We summarize the recent trends and choices made during the selection of medical image processing techniques. Finally, a detailed discussion on the various challenges involved in the analysis of BCHI is presented along with the future scope.},

            Though consistently shown to detect mammographically occult cancers, breast ultrasound has been noted to have high false-positive rates. In this work, we present an AI system that achieves radiologist-level accuracy in identifying breast cancer in ultrasound images. Developed on 288,767 exams, consisting of 5,442,907 B-mode and Color Doppler images, the AI achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.976 on a test set consisting of 44,755 exams. In a retrospective reader study, the AI achieves a higher AUROC than the average of ten board-certified breast radiologists (AUROC: 0.962 AI, 0.924 ± 0.02 radiologists). With the help of the AI, radiologists decrease their false positive rates by 37.3\% and reduce requested biopsies by 27.8\%, while maintaining the same level of sensitivity. This highlights the potential of AI in improving the accuracy, consistency, and efficiency of breast ultrasound diagnosis.},

Databases from PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus were searched for relevant literature. Studies evaluating AI models in the context of prediction and diagnosis of breast malignancies that also reported conventional performance metrics were deemed suitable for inclusion. From 90 unique citations, 21 studies were considered suitable for our examination. Data was not pooled due to heterogeneity in study evaluation methods. \textbf{\textit{Summary:}} Three studies showed the applicability of AI in reducing workload. Six studies demonstrated that AI can aid in diagnosis, with up to 69\% reduction in false positives and an increase in sensitivity ranging from 84 to 91\%. Five studies show how AI models can independently mark and classify suspicious findings on conventional scans, with abilities comparable with radiologists. Seven studies examined AI predictive potential for breast cancer and risk score calculation. \textbf{\textit{Key Messages:}} Despite limitations in the current evidence base and technical obstacles, this review suggests AI has marked potential for extensive use in mammography. Additional works, including large-scale prospective studies, are warranted to elucidate the clinical utility of AI.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer screening has evolved substantially over the past few decades because of advancements in new image acquisition systems and novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms.This review provides a brief overview of the history, current state, and future of AI in breast cancer screening and diagnosis along with challenges involved in the development of AI systems. Although AI has been developing for interpretation tasks associated with breast cancer screening for decades, its potential to combat the subjective nature and improve the efficiency of human image interpretation is always expanding. The rapid advancement of computational power and deep learning has increased greatly in AI research, with promising performance in detection and classification tasks across imaging modalities. Most AI systems, based on human-engineered or deep learning methods, serve as concurrent or secondary readers, that is, as aids to radiologists for a specific, well-defined task. In the future, AI may be able to perform multiple integrated tasks, making decisions at the level of or surpassing the ability of humans. Artificial intelligence may also serve as a partial primary reader to streamline ancillary tasks, triaging cases or ruling out obvious normal cases. However, before AI is used as an independent, autonomous reader, various challenges need to be addressed, including explainability and interpretability, in addition to repeatability and generalizability, to ensure that AI will provide a significant clinical benefit to breast cancer screening across all populations.},

Breast cancer screening is an efficient method to detect indeterminate breast lesions early. The common approaches of screening for women are tomosynthesis and mammography images. However, the traditional manual diagnosis requires an intense workload by pathologists, who are prone to diagnostic errors. Thus, the aim of this study is to build a deep convolutional neural network method for automatic detection, segmentation, and classification of breast lesions in mammography images. Based on deep learning the Mask-CNN (RoIAlign) method was developed to features selection and extraction; and the classification was carried out by DenseNet architecture. Finally, the precision and accuracy of the model is evaluated by cross validation matrix and AUC curve. To summarize, the findings of this study may provide a helpful to improve the diagnosis and efficiency in the automatic tumor localization through the medical image classification.},

	abstract = {It is important to detect breast cancer as early as possible. In this manuscript, a new methodology for classifying breast cancer using deep learning and some segmentation techniques are introduced. A new computer aided detection (CAD) system is proposed for classifying benign and malignant mass tumors in breast mammography images. In this CAD system, two segmentation approaches are used. The first approach involves determining the region of interest (ROI) manually, while the second approach uses the technique of threshold and region based. The deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is used for feature extraction. A well-known DCNN architecture named AlexNet is used and is fine-tuned to classify two classes instead of 1,000 classes. The last fully connected (fc) layer is connected to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to obtain better accuracy. The results are obtained using the following publicly available datasets (1) the digital database for screening mammography (DDSM); and (2) the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM (CBIS-DDSM). Training on a large number of data gives high accuracy rate. Nevertheless, the biomedical datasets contain a relatively small number of samples due to limited patient volume. Accordingly, data augmentation is a method for increasing the size of the input data by generating new data from the original input data. There are many forms for the data augmentation; the one used here is the rotation. The accuracy of the new-trained DCNN architecture is 71.01\% when cropping the ROI manually from the mammogram. The highest area under the curve (AUC) achieved was 0.88 (88\%) for the samples obtained from both segmentation techniques. Moreover, when using the samples obtained from the CBISDDSM, the accuracy of the DCNN is increased to 73.6\%. Consequently, the SVM accuracy becomes 87.2\% with an AUC equaling to 0.94 (94\%). This is the highest AUC value compared to previous work using the same conditions.},

	abstract = {Cancer is one of the most dangerous diseases to humans, and yet no permanent cure has been developed for it. Breast cancer is one of the most common cancer types. According to the National Breast Cancer foundation, in 2020 alone, more than 276,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer and more than 48,000 non-invasive cases were diagnosed in the US. To put these figures in perspective, 64\% of these cases are diagnosed early in the disease’s cycle, giving patients a 99\% chance of survival. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been used effectively in detection and treatment of several dangerous diseases, helping in early diagnosis and treatment, and thus increasing the patient’s chance of survival. Deep learning has been designed to analyze the most important features affecting detection and treatment of serious diseases. For example, breast cancer can be detected using genes or histopathological imaging. Analysis at the genetic level is very expensive, so histopathological imaging is the most common approach used to detect breast cancer. In this research work, we systematically reviewed previous work done on detection and treatment of breast cancer using genetic sequencing or histopathological imaging with the help of deep learning and machine learning. We also provide recommendations to researchers who will work in this field.},

	abstract = {Breast Cancer (BC) is one of the leading cause of deaths worldwide. Approximately 10 million people pass away internationally from breast cancer in the year 2020. Breast Cancer is a fatal disease and very popular among women globally. It is ranked fourth among the fatal diseases of different cancers, for example colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, and brain tumors. Furthermore, the number of new cases of breast cancer is anticipated to upsurge by 70\% in the next twenty years. Consequently, early detection and precise diagnosis of breast cancer plays an essential part in enhancing the diagnosis and improving the breast cancer survival rate of patients from 30 to 50\%. Through the advances of technology in healthcare, deep learning takes a significant role in handling and inspecting a great number of X-ray, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) images. The aim of this study is to propose a deep learning model to detect and classify breast cancers. Breast cancers has eight classes of cancers: benign adenosis, benign fibroadenoma, benign phyllodes tumor, benign tubular adenoma, malignant ductal carcinoma, malignant lobular carcinoma, malignant mucinous carcinoma, and malignant papillary carcinoma. The dataset was collected from Kaggle depository for breast cancer detection and classification. The measurement that was used in the evaluation of the proposed model includes: F1-score, recall, precision, accuracy. The proposed model was trained, validated and tested using the preprocessed dataset. The results showed that Precision was (97.60\%), Recall (97.60\%) and F1-Score (97.58\%).

Conventional method for breast screening is x-ray mammography, which is known to be challenging for early detection of cancer lesions. The dense breast structure produced due to the compression process during imaging lead to difficulties to recognize small size abnormalities. Also, inter- and intra-variations of breast tissues lead to significant difficulties to achieve high diagnosis accuracy using hand-crafted features. Deep learning is an emerging machine learning technology that requires a relatively high computation power. Yet, it proved to be very effective in several difficult tasks that requires decision making at the level of human intelligence. In this paper, we develop a new network architecture inspired by the U-net structure that can be used for effective and early detection of breast cancer. Results indicate a high rate of sensitivity and specificity that indicate potential usefulness of the proposed approach in clinical use.},

With the advent of Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), recently, deep learning techniques have been used effectively in breast cancer detection, facilitating early diagnosis and therefore increasing the chances of patients’ survival. Compared to classical machine learning techniques, deep learning requires less human intervention for similar feature extraction. This study presents a systematic literature review on the deep learning-based methods for breast cancer detection that can guide practitioners and researchers in understanding the challenges and new trends in the ﬁeld. Particularly, different deep learning-based methods for breast cancer detection are investigated, focusing on the genomics and histopathological imaging data. The study speciﬁcally adopts the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), which offer a detailed analysis and synthesis of the published articles. Several studies were searched and gathered, and after the eligibility screening and quality evaluation, 98 articles were identiﬁed. The results of the review indicated that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the most accurate and extensively used model for breast cancer detection, and the accuracy metrics are the most popular method used for performance evaluation. Moreover, datasets utilized for breast cancer detection and the evaluation metrics are also studied. Finally, the challenges and future research direction in breast cancer detection based on deep learning models are also investigated to help researchers and practitioners acquire in-depth knowledge of and insight into the area.},

Second, in the contracting path, enhance features of the Region of Interest(ROI) of the mammogram through the Coordinate Attention Module. Finally, in the expansive path, the local feature enhancement can be achieved by Attention Gates is used instead to combine the shallow layer and upsampling feature maps directly. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a good segmentation effect for the mammogram, and its the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and the Intersection of Union(IoU) are 91.8\% and 85.8\%, respectively. Furthermore, we obtained DSC and IoU of 98.4\%, 96.8\%, respectively, for women with high breast density. Compared with the conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) algorithm, the DSC increased by 3.36\%, IoU increased by 5.91\%.

	abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers that cause death in women. Breast cancer was the most common cancer in 2020, with 2.26 million new cases. Cancer mortalities can be reduced by early detection and treatment. There are two components of early detection: early diagnosis and screening. Our work is related to early diagnosis. Early diagnosis helps to start treatment early, which is more effective and less expensive. The lives of cancer patients can be improved significantly by early detection and avoiding treatment delays. This paper presents the design and development of a secure cloud-based breast cancer diagnosis system. The proposed system uses using convolutional neural network for breast mass classification. Fragile zero watermarking will be implemented to secure the transmission of mammographs. The proposed system will enable women living in remote areas to get the facility for the routine initial screening near their homes without making their identity and medical data vulnerable. It will reduce the cost and time by avoiding frequent visits of the patients to specialized health care centers. On the other hand, it will help enhance the quality of service at specialized healthcare centers by reducing the number of patients in the initial screening.},

            Published research results are difficult to replicate due to the lack of a standard evaluation data set in the area of decision support systems in mammography; most computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) and detection (CADe) algorithms for breast cancer in mammography are evaluated on private data sets or on unspecified subsets of public databases. This causes an inability to directly compare the performance of methods or to replicate prior results. We seek to resolve this substantial challenge by releasing an updated and standardized version of the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) for evaluation of future CADx and CADe systems (sometimes referred to generally as CAD) research in mammography. Our data set, the CBIS-DDSM (Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM), includes decompressed images, data selection and curation by trained mammographers, updated mass segmentation and bounding boxes, and pathologic diagnosis for training data, formatted similarly to modern computer vision data sets. The data set contains 753 calcification cases and 891 mass cases, providing a data-set size capable of analyzing decision support systems in mammography.},

This paper presents an overview of current deep learning methods, starting from the most straightforward concept but accompanied by the mathematical models that are behind the functionality of this type of intelligence. In the first instance, the fundamental concept of artificial neural networks is introduced, progressively covering convolu­ tional structures, recurrent networks, attention models, up to the current structure known as the Transformer. Secondly, all the basic concepts involved in training and other common elements in the design of the archi­ tectures are introduced. Thirdly, some of the key elements in modern networks for medical image classification and segmentation are shown. Subsequently, a review of some applications realized in the last years is shown, where the main features related to DL are highlighted.

Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography collectively account for more than 50\% of current articles. Neuroradiology appears in about one-third of the papers, followed by musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, breast, urogenital, lung/thorax, and abdomen, each representing 6–9\% of articles. With an irreversible increase in the amount of data and the possibility to use AI to identify findings either detectable or not by the human eye, radiology is now moving from a subjective perceptual skill to a more objective science. Radiologists, who were on the forefront of the digital era in medicine, can guide the introduction of AI into healthcare. Yet, they will not be replaced because radiology includes communication of diagnosis, consideration of patient’s values and preferences, medical judgment, quality assurance, education, policy-making, and interventional procedures. The higher efficiency provided by AI will allow radiologists to perform more value-added tasks, becoming more visible to patients and playing a vital role in multidisciplinary clinical teams.},

Here we survey recent progress in the development of modern computer vision techniques—powered by deep learning—for medical applications, focusing on medical imaging, medical video, and clinical deployment. We start by briefly summarizing a decade of progress in convolutional neural networks, including the vision tasks they enable, in the context of healthcare. Next, we discuss several example medical imaging applications that stand to benefit—including cardiology, pathology, dermatology, ophthalmology–and propose new avenues for continued work. We then expand into general medical video, highlighting ways in which clinical workflows can integrate computer vision to enhance care. Finally, we discuss the challenges and hurdles required for real-world clinical deployment of these technologies.},

	abstract = {During the last decade, there is an increasing usage of quantitative methods in Radiology in an effort to reduce the diagnostic variability associated with a subjective manner of radiological interpretation. Combined approaches where visual assessment made by the radiologist is augmented by quantitative imaging biomarkers are gaining attention. Advances in machine learning resulted in the rise of radiomics that is a new methodology referring to the extraction of quantitative information from medical images. Radiomics are based on the development of computational models, referred to as “Radiomic Signatures”, trying to address either unmet clinical needs, mostly in the field of oncologic imaging, or to compare radiomics performance with that of radiologists. However, to explore this new technology, initial publications did not consider best practices in the field of machine learning resulting in publications with questionable clinical value. In this paper, our effort was concentrated on how to avoid methodological mistakes and consider critical issues in the workflow of the development of clinically meaningful radiomic signatures.},

The use of imaging data from routine clinical work-up has tremendous potential in improving cancer care by heightening understanding of tumor biology and aiding in the implementation of precision medicine. As a noninvasive method of assessing the tumor and its microenvironment in their entirety, radiomics allows the evaluation and monitoring of tumor characteristics such as temporal and spatial heterogeneity. One can observe a rapid increase in the number of computational medical imaging publications—milestones that have highlighted the utility of imaging biomarkers in oncology. Nevertheless, the use of radiomics as clinical biomarkers still necessitates amelioration and standardization in order to achieve routine clinical adoption.

	abstract = {Mammography is at present the best available technique for early detection of breast cancer. The most common breast abnormalities that may indicate breast cancer are masses and calcifications. In some cases, subtle signs that can also lead to a breast cancer diagnosis, such as architectural distortion and bilateral asymmetry, are present. Breast abnormalities are defined with wide range of features and may be easily missed or misinterpreted by radiologists while reading large amount of mammographic images provided in screening programs. To help radiologists provide an accurate diagnosis, a computer-aided detection (CADe) and computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) algorithms are being developed. CADe and CADx algorithms help reducing the number of false positives and they assist radiologists in deciding between follow up and biopsy. This chapter gives a survey of image processing algorithms that have been developed for detection of masses and calcifications. An overview of algorithms in each step (segmentation step, feature extraction step, feature selection step, classification step) of the mass detection algorithms is given. Wavelet detection methods and other recently proposed methods for calcification detection are presented. An overview of contrast enhancement and noise equalization methods is given as well as an overview of calcification classification algorithms.},

Mammography has been one of the most reliable methods for early detection of breast carcinomas. However, it is difﬁcult for radiologists to provide both accurate and uniform evaluation for the enormous mammograms generated in widespread screening. The estimated sensitivity of radiologists in breast cancer screening is only about 75\%, but the performance would be improved if they were prompted with the possible locations of abnormalities. Breast cancer CAD systems can provide such help and they are important and necessary for breast cancer control. Microcalciﬁcations and masses are the two most important indicators of malignancy, and their automated detection is very valuable for early breast cancer diagnosis. Since masses are often indistinguishable from the surrounding parenchymal, automated mass detection and classiﬁcation is even more challenging. This paper discusses the methods for mass detection and classiﬁcation, and compares their advantages and drawbacks.},

	abstract = {In recent years, deep learning has been widely applied for mammographic image classiﬁcation. However, most of the existing methods are based on a single mammography view and cannot sufﬁciently extract discriminative features, thereby resulting in an unsatisfactory classiﬁcation accuracy. To solve this problem and improve the mammographic image classiﬁcation performance, we propose a novel multi-view convolutional neural network (CNN) based on multiple mammography views in this paper. Considering that the images acquired from different perspectives contain different and complementary breast mass information, we modify the CNN architecture to exploit the complementary information from the various views of mammography. The new architecture can extract discriminative features from the mediolateral oblique (MLO) and craniocaudal (CC) views of the mammographic images and can effectively incorporate these features for mammographic images. The dilated convolutional layers enable the feature maps extracted from the multiple breast mass views to capture information from a large ‘‘ﬁeld of vision’’. Moreover, multiscale features are obtained by using the convolutional and dilated convolutions. In addition, we incorporate a penalty term into the cross entropy loss function, which enables the model evolution to reduce the misclassiﬁcation rate by enhancing the contributions of the samples misclassiﬁed in the training process. The proposed method was evaluated and compared with several state-of-the-art methods on the open Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) and Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method exhibits a better performance than those of the state-of-the-art methods.},

Existing methods of mammographic density classiﬁcation either require steps of manual operations or achieve only moderate classiﬁcation accuracy due to the limited model capacity. In this study, we present a radiomics approach based on dilated and attention-guided residual learning for the task of mammographic density classiﬁcation. The proposed method was instantiated with two datasets, one clinical dataset and one publicly available dataset, and classiﬁcation accuracies of 88.7 and 70.0 percent were obtained, respectively. Although the classiﬁcation accuracy of the public dataset was lower than the clinical dataset, which was very likely related to the dataset size, our proposed model still achieved a better performance than the naive residual networks and several recently published deep learningbased approaches. Furthermore, we designed a multi-stream network architecture speciﬁcally targeting at analyzing the multi-view mammograms. Utilizing the clinical dataset, we validated that multi-view inputs were beneﬁcial to the breast density classiﬁcation task with an increase of at least 2.0 percent in accuracy and the different views lead to different model classiﬁcation capacities. Our method has a great potential to be further developed and applied in computer-aided diagnosis systems. Our code is available at https://github. com/lich0031/Mammographic\_Density\_Classiﬁcation.},

The convolutional neural network (CNN) has succeeded in a lot of image classiﬁcation challenges during the recent years. In this paper, we proposed an approach of mammogram and tomosynthesis classiﬁcation based on CNNs. We had acquired more than 3000 mammograms and tomosynthesis data with approval from an institutional review board at the University of Kentucky. Different models of CNNs were built to classify both the 2-D mammograms and 3-D tomosynthesis, and every classiﬁer was assessed with respect to truth-values generated by histology results from the biopsy and twoyear negative mammogram follow-up conﬁrmed by expert radiologists. Our outcomes demonstrated that CNN-based models we had built and optimized utilizing transfer learning and data augmentation have good potential for automatic breast cancer detection based on the mammograms and tomosynthesis data.},

              While detection of malignancies on mammography has received a boost with the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), detection of cancers of very small size remains challenging. This is however clinically significant as the purpose of mammography is early detection of cancer, making it imperative to pick them up when they are still very small. Mammography has the highest spatial resolution (image sizes as high as 3328 × 4096 pixels) out of all imaging modalities, a requirement that stems from the need to detect fine features of the smallest cancers on screening. However due to computational constraints, most state of the art CNNs work on reduced resolution images. Those that work on higher resolutions, compromise on global context and work at single scale. In this work, we show that resolution, scale and image-context are all important independent factors in detection of small masses. We thereby use a fully convolutional network, with the ability to take any input size. In addition, we incorporate a systematic multi-scale, multi-resolution approach, and encode image context, which we show are critical factors to detection of small masses. We show that this approach improves the detection of cancer, particularly for small masses in comparison to the baseline model. We perform a single institution multicentre study, and show the performance of the model on a diagnostic mammography dataset, a screening mammography dataset, as well as a curated dataset of small cancers {\textless} 1 cm in size. We show that our approach improves the sensitivity from 61.53 to 87.18\% at 0.3 False Positives per Image (FPI) on this small cancer dataset. Model and code are available from

	abstract = {Mammogram malignancy classiﬁcation with only image-level annotations is challenging due to a lack of lesion annotations. If we can generate the healthy version of the diseased data, we can easily explore the lesion features. An intuitive idea of such generation is to use existing Cycle-GAN based methods. They achieve the healthy generation regarding healthy images as reference domain, while maintaining the original content by cycle consistency mechanism. However, healthy mammogram patterns are diverse which may lead to uncertain generations. Moreover, the back translation from healthy to the original remains an ill-posed problem due to lack of lesion information. To address these problems, we propose a novel model called bilateral residual generating adversarial network(BR-GAN). We use the Cycle-GAN as a basic framework while regarding the contralateral as generation reference based on the bilateral symmetry prior. To address the ill-posed back translation problem, we propose a residual-preserved mechanism to try to preserve the lesion features from the original features. The generated features and the original features are aggregated for further classiﬁcation. BR-GAN outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on INBreast and in-house datasets.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is a type of cancer that has risen to be the second cause of death among women. Classiﬁcation of breast tissues into normal, benign, or malignant depends on the presence of abnormalities like microcalciﬁcations, masses, architectural distortions, and asymmetries. Architectural distortion (AD) is subtle in detection with no association with masses but shows the abnormal arrangement of tissue strands, often in a radial, spiculation, or random pattern. It is widely rated as the third symptom of breast cancer which is the most commonly missed abnormality. Most computational approaches characterizing abnormalities in breast images often concentrate on the detection of microcalciﬁcation and masses with architectural distortions appearing as a secondary ﬁnding. The subtle nature and a minimal occurrence of architectural distortions may seem to complicate computational approaches for its detection. As a result, little research interest has been recorded in this area. It is widely reported that some cases of recent breast cancer are wrongly diagnosed due to the omission in detecting the presence of architectural distortion at the early stage of the disease. However, we discovered that most computational solutions to early detection of breast cancer are focused mainly on detecting other abnormalities such as masses and microcalciﬁcation, which are some evidence of the advanced stage of the disease. To emphasise the little efforts channeled towards detection of AD compared to other abnormalities, this article aims to detail the review of such studies in the last decade. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the ﬁrst review which focuses on the detection of architectural distortion (AD) from mammographic images. Furthermore, this article presents a comprehensive review of approaches, advances, and challenges on the computational methods for detecting AD, with the sole aim of advancing the use of deep learning models in detecting AD. Moreover, a comparative study of performance analyses of articles surveyed in this article is investigated. Our ﬁndings revealed that about 70\% of the existing literature adopted Gabor Filters, while just less than 10\% leveraged on the state-ofthe-art performances recorded in computer vision and deep learning, in building outstanding computational models for the detection of AD. The current study also discovered that using a deep learning approach, such as the convolution neural network (CNN) method, can yield a signiﬁcant increase in performance for the task of detection of architectural distortions. This assertion is based on literature results obtained using the CNN, which generates an accuracy of 99.4\% compared to the use of Gabor ﬁlters method, which accounts for 95\% accuracy.},

	abstract = {Judgement, as one of the core tenets of medicine, relies upon the integration of multilayered data with nuanced decision making. Cancer offers a unique context for medical decisions given not only its variegated forms with evolution of disease but also the need to take into account the individual condition of patients, their ability to receive treatment, and their responses to treatment. Challenges remain in the accurate detection, characterization, and monitoring of cancers despite improved technologies. Radiographic assessment of disease most commonly relies upon visual evaluations, the interpretations of which may be augmented by advanced computational analyses. In particular, artificial intelligence (AI) promises to make great strides in the qualitative interpretation of cancer imaging by expert clinicians, including volumetric delineation of tumors over time, extrapolation of the tumor genotype and biological course from its radiographic phenotype, prediction of clinical outcome, and assessment of the impact of disease and treatment on adjacent organs. AI may automate processes in the initial interpretation of images and shift the clinical workflow of radiographic detection, management decisions on whether or not to administer an intervention, and subsequent observation to a yet to be envisioned paradigm. Here, the authors review the current state of AI as applied to medical imaging of cancer and describe advances in 4 tumor types (lung, brain, breast, and prostate) to illustrate how common clinical problems are being addressed. Although most studies evaluating AI applications in oncology to date have not been vigorously validated for reproducibility and generalizability, the results do highlight increasingly concerted efforts in pushing AI technology to ­clinical use and to impact future directions in cancer care.

We extend the basic LBP histogram descriptor into a spatially enhanced histogram which encodes both the local region appearance and the spatial structure of the masses. Support Vector Machines (SVM) are then used for classifying the true masses from the ones being actually normal parenchyma. Our approach is evaluated using 1792 ROIs extracted from the DDSM database. The experiments show that LBP are effective and efﬁcient descriptors for mammographic masses. Moreover, the comparison with current methods illustrates that our proposal obtains a better performance.},

This is a holistic methodology that can classify a whole mammographic exam, containing the CC and MLO views and the segmentation maps, as opposed to the classiﬁcation of individual lesions, which is the dominant approach in the ﬁeld. We also demonstrate that the proposed system is capable of using the segmentation maps generated by automated mass and micro-calciﬁcation detection systems, and still producing accurate results. The semi-automated approach (using manually deﬁned mass and micro-calciﬁcation segmentation maps) is tested on two publicly available datasets (INbreast and DDSM), and results show that the volume under ROC surface (VUS) for a 3-class problem (normal tissue, benign and malignant) is over 0.9, the area under ROC curve (AUC) for the 2-class ”benign vs malignant” problem is over 0.9, and for the 2class breast screening problem (malignancy vs normal/benign) is also over 0.9. For the fully automated approach, the VUS results on INbreast is over 0.7, and the AUC for the 2-class ”benign vs malignant” problem is over 0.78, and the AUC for the 2-class breast screening is 0.86.},

We propose that the most meaningful measure is one that is designed speciﬁcally to match that perceived by the radiologists in their interpretation of mammogram lesions. In our approach, we model the notion of similarity as an unknown function of the image features characterizing the lesions, and use modern machine-learning algorithms to learn this function from similarity scores collected from radiologists in reader studies. This approach is evaluated using data collected from an observer study with a set of clinical mammograms. Our results demonstrate that the proposed machine learning approach can be used to model the notion of similarity as judged by expert readers in their interpretation of mammogram images and that it can outperform alternative similarity measures derived from unsupervised learning.},

	abstract = {The problem of computer-aided detection of architectural distortion (AD) in a digitised mammogram has been attempted in this manuscript. In examining a mammogram, the decision regarding a particular region of interest (RoI) is dependent on the appearance of the surrounding regions. However, in existing methods to detect AD the inference about an RoI is dependent on the appearance of this RoI alone. In addition, multiple radiologists infer the same mammogram in coming to a final decision about the mammogram. Contrary to popular ensemble classifiers like Adaboost and Random Forest, the authors propose an ensemble based method (imitating multiple radiologists by classifiers) for detecting AD such that the decision on a test RoI is dependent on the decisions of the surrounding RoIs in the proposed ensemble classifier. The proposed contextbased ensemble classifier has been validated on two mammographic databases. The proposal shows promising results in both the databases.},

	abstract = {Background and objective: The automatic classiﬁcation of breast imaging lesions is currently an unsolved problem. This paper describes an innovative representation learning framework for breast cancer diagnosis in mammography that integrates deep learning techniques to automatically learn discriminative features avoiding the design of speciﬁc hand-crafted image-based feature detectors.
Methods: A new biopsy proven benchmarking dataset was built from 344 breast cancer patients’ cases containing a total of 736 ﬁlm mammography (mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal) views, representative of manually segmented lesions associated with masses: 426 benign lesions and 310 malignant lesions. The developed method comprises two main stages: (i) preprocessing to enhance image details and (ii) supervised training for learning both the features and the breast imaging lesions classiﬁer. In contrast to previous works, we adopt a hybrid approach where convolutional neural networks are used to learn the representation in a supervised way instead of designing particular descriptors to explain the content of mammography images.
Results: Experimental results using the developed benchmarking breast cancer dataset demonstrated that our method exhibits signiﬁcant improved performance when compared to state-of-the-art image descriptors, such as histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and histogram of the gradient divergence (HGD), increasing the performance from 0.787 to 0.822 in terms of the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Interestingly, this model also outperforms a set of hand-crafted features that take advantage of additional information from segmentation by the radiologist. Finally, the combination of both representations, learned and hand-crafted, resulted in the best descriptor for mass lesion classiﬁcation, obtaining 0.826 in the AUC score.
Conclusions: A novel deep learning based framework to automatically address classiﬁcation of breast mass lesions in mammography was developed. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

              In the last two decades, Computer Aided Detection (CAD) systems were developed to help radiologists analyse screening mammograms, however benefits of current CAD technologies appear to be contradictory, therefore they should be improved to be ultimately considered useful. Since 2012, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been a tremendous success in image recognition, reaching human performance. These methods have greatly surpassed the traditional approaches, which are similar to currently used CAD solutions. Deep CNN-s have the potential to revolutionize medical image analysis. We propose a CAD system based on one of the most successful object detection frameworks, Faster R-CNN. The system detects and classifies malignant or benign lesions on a mammogram without any human intervention. The proposed method sets the state of the art classification performance on the public INbreast database, AUC = 0.95. The approach described here has achieved 2nd place in the Digital Mammography DREAM Challenge with AUC = 0.85. When used as a detector, the system reaches high sensitivity with very few false positive marks per image on the INbreast dataset.

	abstract = {Deep learning approaches to breast cancer detection in mammograms have recently shown promising results. However, such models are constrained by the limited size of publicly available mammography datasets, in large part due to privacy concerns and the high cost of generating expert annotations. Limited dataset size is further exacerbated by substantial class imbalance since “normal” images dramatically outnumber those with ﬁndings. Given the rapid progress of generative models in synthesizing realistic images, and the known eﬀectiveness of simple data augmentation techniques (e.g. horizontal ﬂipping), we ask if it is possible to synthetically augment mammogram datasets using generative adversarial networks (GANs). We train a class-conditional GAN to perform contextual in-ﬁlling, which we then use to synthesize lesions onto healthy screening mammograms. First, we show that GANs are capable of generating high-resolution synthetic mammogram patches. Next, we experimentally evaluate using the augmented dataset to improve breast cancer classiﬁcation performance. We observe that a ResNet-50 classiﬁer trained with GAN-augmented training data produces a higher AUROC compared to the same model trained only on traditionally augmented data, demonstrating the potential of our approach.},

We develop a context-sensitive deep neural network (DNN), aimed to take into account both the local image features of an MC and its surrounding tissue background, for MC detection. The DNN classiﬁer is trained to automatically extract the relevant image features of an MC as well as its image context. The proposed approach was evaluated on a set of 292 mammograms using free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) analysis on the accuracy both in detecting individual MCs and in detecting MC clusters. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach could achieve signiﬁcantly higher FROC curves when compared to two MC-based detectors. It indicates that incorporating image context information in MC detection can be beneﬁcial for reducing the FPs in detections.},

The information from the two paired views (i.e., medio-lateral oblique and craniocaudal) are highly relational and complementary, and this is crucial for doctors’ decisions in clinical practice. However, existing mass detection methods do not consider jointly learning eﬀective features from the two relational views. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel mammogram mass detection framework, termed Cross-View Relation Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CVR-RCNN). The proposed CVR-RCNN is expected to capture the latent relation information between the corresponding mass region of interests (ROIs) from the two paired views. Evaluations on a new large-scale private dataset and a public mammogram dataset show that the proposed CVR-RCNN outperforms existing state-of-the-art mass detection methods. Meanwhile, our experimental results suggest that incorporating the relation information across two views helps to train a superior detection model, which is a promising avenue for mammogram mass detection.},

Can we combine ROI-oriented algorithms with global classiﬁcation of cancer status, which simultaneously highlight suspicious regions and optimize classiﬁcation performance? Can the asymmetry of breasts be adopted in deep learning for ﬁnding lesions and classifying cancers? We answer the above questions by building deep-learning networks that identify masses and microcalciﬁcations in paired mammograms, exclude false positives, and stepwisely improve performance of the model with asymmetric information regarding the breasts. This method achieved a co-leading place in the Digital Mammography DREAM Challenge for predicting breast cancer. We highlight here the importance of this dual-purpose process that simultaneously provides the locations of potential lesions in mammograms.},

	abstract = {Mass detection is a critical process in the examination of mammograms. The shape and texture of the mass are key parameters used in the diagnosis of breast cancer. To recover the shape of the mass, semantic segmentation is found to be more useful rather than mere object detection (or) localization. The main challenges involved in the mass segmentation include: (a) low signal to noise ratio (b) indiscernible mass boundaries, and (c) more false positives. These problems arise due to the significant overlap in the intensities of both the normal parenchymal region and the mass region. To address these challenges, deeply supervised U-Net model (DS U-Net) coupled with dense conditional random fields (CRFs) is proposed. Here, the input images are preprocessed using CLAHE and a modified encoder-decoder-based deep learning model is used for segmentation. In general, the encoder captures the textual information of various regions in an input image, whereas the decoder recovers the spatial location of the desired region of interest. The encoderdecoder-based models lack the ability to recover the non-conspicuous and spiculated mass boundaries. In the proposed work, deep supervision is integrated with a popular encoder-decoder model (U-Net) to improve the attention of the network toward the boundary of the suspicious regions. The final segmentation map is also created as a linear combination of the intermediate feature maps and the output feature map. The dense CRF is then used to finetune the segmentation map for the recovery of definite edges. The DS U-Net with dense CRF is evaluated on two publicly available benchmark datasets CBIS-DDSM and INBREAST. It provides a dice score of 82.9\% for CBIS-DDSM and 79\% for INBREAST.},

In this regard, U-Net has been the most popular architecture in the medical imaging community. Despite outstanding overall performance in segmenting multimodal medical images, through extensive experimentations on some challenging datasets, we demonstrate that the classical U-Net architecture seems to be lacking in certain aspects. Therefore, we propose some modifications to improve upon the already state-of-the-art U-Net model. Following these modifications, we develop a novel architecture, MultiResUNet, as the potential successor to the U-Net architecture. We have tested and compared MultiResUNet with the classical U-Net on a vast repertoire of multimodal medical images. Although only slight improvements in the cases of ideal images are noticed, remarkable gains in performance have been attained for the challenging ones. We have evaluated our model on five different datasets, each with their own unique challenges, and have obtained a relative improvement in performance of 10.15\%, 5.07\%, 2.63\%, 1.41\%, and 0.62\% respectively. We have also discussed and highlighted some qualitatively superior aspects of MultiResUNet over classical U-Net that are not really reflected in the quantitative measures.},

	abstract = {Mammogram mass detection is crucial for diagnosing and preventing the breast cancers in clinical practice. The complementary effect of multi-view mammogram images provides valuable information about the breast anatomical prior structure and is of great signiﬁcance in digital mammography interpretation. However, unlike radiologists who can utilize the natural reasoning ability to identify masses based on multiple mammographic views, how to endow the existing object detection models with the capability of multi-view reasoning is vital for decision-making in clinical diagnosis but remains the boundary to explore. In this paper, we propose an Anatomy-aware Graph convolutional Network (AGN), which is tailored for mammogram mass detection and endows existing detection methods with multi-view reasoning ability. The proposed AGN consists of three steps. Firstly, we introduce a Bipartite Graph convolutional Network (BGN) to model the intrinsic geometric and semantic relations of ipsilateral views. Secondly, considering that the visual asymmetry of bilateral views is widely adopted in clinical practice to assist the diagnosis of breast lesions, we propose an Inception Graph convolutional Network (IGN) to model the structural similarities of bilateral views. Finally, based on the constructed graphs, the multi-view information is propagated through nodes methodically, which equips the features learned from the examined view with multi-view reasoning ability. Experiments on two standard benchmarks reveal that AGN signiﬁcantly exceeds the state-of-the-art performance. Visualization results show that AGN provides interpretable visual cues for clinical diagnosis.},

Our approach is based on a multi-context ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), aiming at learning different levels of image spatial context and improving detection performance. The main innovation behind the proposed method is the use of multiple-depth CNNs, individually trained on image patches of different dimensions and then combined together. In this way, the final ensemble is able to find and locate abnormalities on the images by exploiting both the local features and the surrounding context of a lesion. Experiments were focused on two well-known medical detection problems that have been recently faced with CNNs: microcalcification detection on full-field digital mammograms and microaneurysm detection on ocular fundus images. To this end, we used two publicly available datasets, INbreast and E-ophtha. Statistically significantly better detection performance were obtained by the proposed ensemble with respect to other approaches in the literature, demonstrating its effectiveness in the detection of small abnormalities.},

However, detecting abnormalities in breast tissue is diﬃcult due to the lesion’s varying size, shape, margin, and contrast with the background tissue. We focused on mass segmentation, a method that provides notable morphological features by outlining contours of masses. Accurate segmentation is crucial for correct diagnosis. Recent advancements in deep learning have improved object detection and segmentation, and these techniques are also being applied to medical imaging studies. We focused on U-net, which is a recently developed mass segmentation algorithm based on a fully convolutional network. The U-net architecture consists of (1) a contracting path to increase the resolution of the output and (2) a symmetric expanding path to better locate the region of interest. The performance of a U-net model was tested with 63 digital mammograms from INbreast, a publicly available database. We trained the model with images resized to 40x40 pixels and conducted 10-fold cross-validation to prevent overﬁtting. The model’s performance with respect to breast density and the lesion’s BI-RADS rating was also investigated. Dice coeﬃcients (DC) were used as a performance measure to compare the predicted segmentation of the model with the ground truth. Logistic regression and an analysis of variance were performed to determine the signiﬁcance of the DCs with regards to breast density and lesion behavior and to calculate the 95\% conﬁdence interval. The average DC was 0.80. The diﬀerence between DCs for BI-RADS 2 and 4c and for BI-RADS 2 and 5 were signiﬁcant, suggesting that the model has more diﬃculty in segmenting benign lesions.},

            Deep learning (DL) models are becoming pervasive and applicable to computer vision, image processing, and synthesis problems. The performance of these models is often improved through architectural configuration, tweaks, the use of enormous training data, and skillful selection of hyperparameters. The application of deep learning models to medical image processing has yielded interesting performance, capable of correctly detecting abnormalities in medical digital images, making them surpass human physicians. However, advancing research in this domain largely relies on the availability of training datasets. These datasets are sometimes not publicly accessible, insufficient for training, and may also be characterized by a class imbalance among samples. As a result, inadequate training samples and difficulty in accessing new datasets for training deep learning models limit performance and research into new domains. Hence, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been proposed to mediate this gap by synthesizing data similar to real sample images. However, we observed that benchmark datasets with regions of interest (ROIs) for characterizing abnormalities in breast cancer using digital mammography do not contain sufficient data with a fair distribution of all cases of abnormalities. For instance, the architectural distortion and breast asymmetry in digital mammograms are sparsely distributed across most publicly available datasets. This paper proposes a GAN model, named ROImammoGAN, which synthesizes ROI-based digital mammograms. Our approach involves the design of a GAN model consisting of both a generator and a discriminator to learn a hierarchy of representations for abnormalities in digital mammograms. Attention is given to architectural distortion, asymmetry, mass, and microcalcification abnormalities so that training distinctively learns the features of each abnormality and generates sufficient images for each category. The proposed GAN model was applied to MIAS datasets, and the performance evaluation yielded a competitive accuracy for the synthesized samples. In addition, the quality of the images generated was also evaluated using PSNR, SSIM, FSIM, BRISQUE, PQUE, NIQUE, FID, and geometry scores. The results showed that ROImammoGAN performed competitively with state-of-the-art GANs. The outcome of this study is a model for augmenting CNN models with ROI-centric image samples for the characterization of abnormalities in breast images.},

	abstract = {Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a commonly encountered malignancy, accounting for approximately 20\% of new breast cancer diagnoses in the United States. DCIS is characterized by a proliferation of tumor cells within the terminal duct lobular unit with preservation of the basement membrane. Typically nonpalpable and asymptomatic, DCIS is most often detected as calcifications on screening mammography. However, DCIS may also be noncalcified. When compared to calcified DCIS, noncalcified DCIS is more likely to be symptomatic, with patients most often presenting with nipple discharge or a palpable mass. Diagnosing noncalcified DCIS is challenging since it may be occult or subtle on mammography, and ultrasound findings can be nonspecific and may be interpreted as benign fibrocystic changes. In cases with a calcified component of DCIS, the extent of DCIS may be underestimated by mammography because not all involved areas may calcify. Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although less readily available than mammography and ultrasound, is advantageous in detecting noncalcified DCIS, especially high grade DCIS, which may not develop microcalcifications. MRI relies on abnormal contrast uptake due to tumor vascularity and changes in vessel density and permeability. This pictoral review presents the spectrum of imaging findings of noncalcified DCIS to assist radiologists in accurately detecting and describing its key imaging findings. Utilizing different modalities, we review the differential diagnoses for noncalcified DCIS, show illustrative cases of noncalcified DCIS, and discuss the importance of this entity.},

	abstract = {Mammography is the ﬁrst option for screening breast cancer. However, some lesions may be missed due to superimposition of breast parenchymal patterns/tissues. Current enhancement methods can highlight some speciﬁc tissues, but the edges are weakened or extra noise is added. For improving the solution, this paper proposed a multiscale contrast enhancement for mammogram using dynamic unsharp masking (UM) in Laplacian pyramid. Laplacian pyramid is utilized to preserve the ﬁne structure at each scale. Dynamic UM is presented to adaptively enhance details and suppress noise simultaneously. The proposed method mainly consists of ﬁve steps: 1) downsample images; 2) calculate the weight of dynamic UM; 3) utilize dynamic UM enhancement for each scale image; 4) subtract the enhancement results for each scale image to acquire Laplacian pyramid images; and 5) restore the ﬁnal enhanced image. To evaluate the proposed method qualitatively and quantitatively, one phantom and three clinical mammography cases were evaluated. Results showed the proposed method can provide much clearer details of the mammary gland. Quantitatively, information entropy and peak signal-to-noise ratio are increased by 0.96 and 3.89 at most compared with the state-of-the-art method. The proposed method has demonstrated that different types of regions are enhanced with the help of a regional adaptive evolution, which has great potential for adaptively enhancing the details and relatively suppressing the noise.},

Metastasis detection is currently performed by pathologists reviewing large expanses of biological tissues. This process is labor intensive and error-prone. We present a framework to automatically detect and localize tumors as small as 100 × 100 pixels in gigapixel microscopy images sized 100, 000×100, 000 pixels. Our method leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and obtains state-of-the-art results on the Camelyon16 dataset in the challenging lesion-level tumor detection task. At 8 false positives per image, we detect 92.4\% of the tumors, relative to 82.7\% by the previous best automated approach. For comparison, a human pathologist attempting exhaustive search achieved 73.2\% sensitivity. We achieve image-level AUC scores above 97\% on both the Camelyon16 test set and an independent set of 110 slides. In addition, we discover that two slides in the Camelyon16 training set were erroneously labeled normal. Our approach could considerably reduce false negative rates in metastasis detection.},

	abstract = {Medical imaging is a rich source of invaluable information necessary for clinical judgements. However, the analysis of those exams is not a trivial assignment. In recent times, the use of deep learning (DL) techniques, supervised or unsupervised, has been empowered and it is one of the current research key areas in medical image analysis. This paper presents a survey of the use of DL architectures in computer-assisted imaging contexts, attending two different image modalities: the actively studied computed tomography and the under-studied positron emission tomography, as well as the combination of both modalities, which has been an important landmark in several decisions related to numerous diseases. In the making of this review, we analysed over 180 relevant studies, published between 2014 and 2019, that are sectioned by the purpose of the research and the imaging modality type. We conclude by addressing research issues and suggesting future directions for further improvement. To our best knowledge, there is no previous work making a review of this issue.},

	abstract = {Background:  Recent deep learning (DL) approaches have shown promise in improving sensitivity but have not addressed limitations in radiologist specificity or efficiency.
Purpose:  To develop a DL model to triage a portion of mammograms as cancer free, improving performance and workflow efficiency. Materials and Methods:  In this retrospective study, 223 109 consecutive screening mammograms performed in 66 661 women from January 2009 to December 2016 were collected with cancer outcomes obtained through linkage to a regional tumor registry. This cohort was split by patient into 212 272, 25 999, and 26 540 mammograms from 56 831, 7021, and 7176 patients for training, validation, and testing, respectively. A DL model was developed to triage mammograms as cancer free and evaluated on the test set. A DL-triage workflow was simulated in which radiologists skipped mammograms triaged as cancer free (interpreting them as negative for cancer) and read mammograms not triaged as cancer free by using the original interpreting radiologists’ assessments. Sensitivities, specificities, and percentage of mammograms read were calculated, with and without the DL-triage–simulated workflow. Statistics were computed across 5000 bootstrap samples to assess confidence intervals (CIs). Specificities were compared by using a two-tailed t test (P , .05) and sensitivities were compared by using a one-sided t test with a noninferiority margin of 5\% (P , .05).
Results:  The test set included 7176 women (mean age, 57.8 years 6 10.9 [standard deviation]). When reading all mammograms, radiologists obtained a sensitivity and specificity of 90.6\% (173 of 191; 95\% CI: 86.6\%, 94.7\%) and 93.5\% (24 625 of 26 349; 95\% CI: 93.3\%, 93.9\%). In the DL-simulated workflow, the radiologists obtained a sensitivity and specificity of 90.1\% (172 of 191; 95\% CI: 86.0\%, 94.3\%) and 94.2\% (24 814 of 26 349; 95\% CI: 94.0\%, 94.6\%) while reading 80.7\% (21 420 of 26 540) of the mammograms. The simulated workflow improved specificity (P = .002) and obtained a noninferior sensitivity with a margin of 5\% (P , .001).
Conclusion:  This deep learning model has the potential to reduce radiologist workload and significantly improve specificity without harming sensitivity.},

However, existing techniques for autonomous diagnosis do not surpass a well-trained radiologist. Therefore, to reduce the number of mammograms that require examination by a radiologist, subject to preserving the diagnostic accuracy observed in current clinical practice, we develop Man and Machine Mammography Oracle (MAMMO)—a clinical decision support system capable of determining whether its predicted diagnoses require further radiologist examination. We first introduce a novel multi-view convolutional neural network (CNN) trained using multi-task learning (MTL) to diagnose mammograms and predict the radiological assessments known to be associated with cancer. MTL improves diagnostic performance and triage efficiency while providing an additional layer of model interpretability. Furthermore, we introduce a novel triage network that takes as input the radiological assessment and diagnostic predictions of the multi-view CNN and determines whether the radiologist or CNN will most likely provide the correct diagnosis. Results obtained on a dataset of over 7,000 patients show that MAMMO reduced the number of diagnostic mammograms requiring radiologist reading by 42.8\% while improving the overall diagnostic accuracy in comparison to readings done by radiologists alone.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common malignancy that affects women all over the world, especially in morocco with 35.8\% [1]. The effective way to diagnose and treat breast cancer is the earlier detection of symptoms and signs which can arise the chances of preconizing an earlier treatment, probably specific one. Thus, it can extremely affect the chances to survive by delaying the cancer or the total elimination. Mammography is a highly accurate radiography technique that represents a basic and crucial phase in preventing and detecting early this disease. Using the mammography images, we propose in this paper to develop a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system named Earlier Breast Cancer Computer Aided Detection (EBCCAD) which aim is to detect and classify breast cancer images. The obtained results are promising and encouraging to evaluate the proposed system for real cases.},

Using the BACH dataset, we have developed an image classification pipeline that combines both a shallow learner (support vector machine) and a deep learner (convolutional neural network). The shallow learner and deep learners achieved moderate accuracies of 79\% and 81\% individually. When being integrated by fusion algorithms, the system outperformed any individual learner with the highest accuracy as 92\%. The fusion presents big potential for improving clinical design support.

	abstract = {Medical errors are considered as the leading cause of death and injury. Breast cancer becomes one of the leading causes of death among women, not only in the Philippines but worldwide. In this paper, data mining was used to predict the stage of breast cancer using a hybrid of fuzzy logic and decision tree. This aims to help experts to make decisions rather than replacing them. The result will only give an expert a recommendation, but the final decision is still on the hands of the experts. Feature selection was used to determine the best attribute in the dataset from Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER). The data set consists of incidence from 1975 to 2016, but the study limits the analysis from 2010 to 2016. Different cleaning and preprocessing of data are conducted. After thorough preprocessing of data, six (6) attributes are selected, and one (1) target class. Performance comparison shows that the fuzzy decision tree achieved a higher accuracy of 99.96\%, sensitivity of 99.26\% and specificity of 99.98\% than the decision tree classification technique. The simulation result shows a correctly classified instance of 165,124, which is equivalent to 99.97\% and only 351 incorrect classified instances or 0.21\%. Thus, a fuzzy decision tree is more robust than the traditional decision tree classifier for predicting the stage of breast cancer.},

Despite the consensus that breast cancer early detection can significantly reduce treatment difficulty and cancer mortality, people still are reluctant to go to hospital for regular checkups due to the high costs incurred. A timely, private, affordable, and effective household breast cancer early detection solution is badly needed. In this paper, we propose a household solution that utilizes pairs of sensors embedded in the bra to measure the thermal and moisture time series data (BTMTSD) of the breast surface and conduct time series classification (TSC) to diagnose breast cancer. Three main challenges are encountered when doing BTMTSD classification, (1) small supervised dataset, which is a common limitation of medical research, (2) noisy time series with unique noise patterns, and (3) complex interplay patterns across multiple time series dimensions. To mitigate these problems, we incorporate multiple data augmentation and transformation techniques with various deep learning TSC approaches and compare their performances for the BTMTSD classification task. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our framework in providing reliable breast cancer early detection.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is a topic that is frequently discussed these days. It is one of the most widespread diseases and forms of cancer. The National Cancer Institute says that the second most frequent malignancy in women is breast cancer. Every year, around 2000 new instances of breast cancer are diagnosed in males, while approximately 2,30,000 new cases are diagnosed in women. The diagnosis of this disease is crucial so that women can get it treated in its early stages. It is best for an precise and timely diagnosis. This is a critical phase in the therapy and recovery process. Breast cancer detection is done with the help of mammograms, which are basically X-rays of the breasts. It's a tool that is used to detect and help diagnose breast cancer. But detection is not easy due to different kinds of uncertainties in using these mammograms. Breast cancer can be detected using machine learning algorithms. These approaches can be used to create tools for clinicians that can be used to identify and diagnose breast cancer at an early stage. This will significantly improve patient survival rates.},

The development of massive breast cancer screening has led to earlier diagnosis and rapid management with a significant improvement in survival rate. The problem of automatically searching for information contained in medical images is urgently needed. In order to process this large volume of information, doctors are currently turning to the use of Machine Learning (ML) systems to assist in the analysis and interpretation of these images. In this paper, we have conducted an experimental study for three major ML algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to classify Brest cancer. The experiments were conducted on WDBC dataset to obtain the best algorithms in term of accuracy. Finally, identify the most specific and relevant attributes of the malignant tumour classification through more than one feature selection algorithms.},

	abstract = {Accurate breast cancer detection using automated algorithms remains a problem within the literature. Although a plethora of work has tried to address this issue, an exact solution is yet to be found. This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that most of the existing datasets are imbalanced, i.e., the number of instances of a particular class far exceeds that of the others. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the notion of transfer learning to address this issue and focus our efforts on histopathological and imbalanced image classification. We use the popular VGG-19 as the base model and complement it with several state-of-the-art techniques to improve the overall performance of the system. With the ImageNet dataset taken as the source domain, we apply the learned knowledge in the target domain consisting of histopathological images. With experimentation performed on a large-scale dataset consisting of 277,524 images, we show that the framework proposed in this paper gives superior performance than those available in the existing literature. Through numerical simulations conducted on a supercomputer, we also present guidelines for work in transfer learning and imbalanced image classification.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is one of serious diseases that affect mainly woman and late diagnosis can lead to death. However early diagnosis increases survivability significantly, therefore making it very important. There are different diagnosis techniques for early detection of breast cancer. Breast tissue samples analyzed under microscope is considered reliable way to diagnose breast cancer. Automated classification techniques are so popular in many areas in order to reduce human dependency considering third world countries. Our purpose is to determine if sample is malignant or benign in automated manner. Many algorithms are studied so far in medical area along with other areas. However, algorithms are generally too complex even for simple tasks. We propose a simple algorithm that can differentiate cancerous and non-cancerous samples from breast tissue in automated manner. The images were taken from Near East University Hospital which is consisted of 50 cancerous and 100 healthy images. Total of 150 images were correctly differentiated through our algorithm.},

However, the different expression patterns of the four HER family genes and their correlation with cancer immune infiltrate have not been analyzed. In this article, we analyzed the expression level of the HER family in breast cancer patients through Oncomine and Interactive Analysis of Gene Expression Profiles (GEPIA). We found that the expression levels of ERBB2 and ERBB3 in invasive breast cancer (BCRA) tissues were higher than those in normal breast tissues, while the expression levels of EGFR in the former were lower than those in the latter. Using the Tumor Immunity Estimation Resource (TIMER) database to study the correlation between the HER family and breast cancer immune infiltrates shows that the expression of the HER family is significantly associated with tumor purity and the level of infiltration of various immune cells. This study laid the foundation for further exploration of the molecular mechanism of the HER family in breast cancer.},

This study chose gene expression profile of GSE65194, GSE42568, GSE7904 and GSE10810 from GEO databases in order to screen potential biomarkers of breast cancer. There are 393 samples, including 331 cancer samples and 62 normal samples. We screened the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from four groups between BRCA samples and normal samples, then 150 common DEGs were detected, including 37 upregulated genes and 113 downregulated genes. Next this study used Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) performed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Moreover, we selected 15 core genes with high connectivity, including CCNB1, CDC20, BUB1B, AURKA, CDK1 and RRM2. The Kaplan Meier plotter (KM plotter) analyzed these six core genes survival rate. Finally, this study analyzed that all six genes were significantly expressed in BRCA. In conclusion, the bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that the six core genes CCNB1, CDK1, BUB1B, CDC20, AURKA and RRM2 might promote the development of BRCA, that could became new biomarkers for diagnosis and medications of BRCA.},

The task of correctly diagnosing cancer using histopathology in its very earlier stages is a challenging and critical task. Most of the present machine learning techniques require a lot of data to analyze and predict a benign tumour in its early stages, and such data is not available readily. In this paper, we propose the idea of data augmentation of breast cancer tissue images by addressing data intrinsic characteristics. The aim is to detect the micro presence of the tumour cells and highlight it over multiple synthetic images for classifiers to predict benign tumours in very early stages with high accuracy. The initial experimental analysis highlights the proposed technique’s impact and significance in boosting the performance of standard classifier(s).},

	abstract = {Objectives
              The objective of this study was to develop and validate a state-of-the-art, deep learning (DL)-based model for detecting breast cancers on mammography.
            
            
              Methods
              Mammograms in a hospital development dataset, a hospital test dataset, and a clinic test dataset were retrospectively collected from January 2006 through December 2017 in Osaka City University Hospital and Medcity21 Clinic. The hospital development dataset and a publicly available digital database for screening mammography (DDSM) dataset were used to train and to validate the RetinaNet, one type of DL-based model, with five-fold cross-validation. The model’s sensitivity and mean false positive indications per image (mFPI) and partial area under the curve (AUC) with 1.0 mFPI for both test datasets were externally assessed with the test datasets.
            
            
              Results
              The hospital development dataset, hospital test dataset, clinic test dataset, and DDSM development dataset included a total of 3179 images (1448 malignant images), 491 images (225 malignant images), 2821 images (37 malignant images), and 1457 malignant images, respectively. The proposed model detected all cancers with a 0.45–0.47 mFPI and had partial AUCs of 0.93 in both test datasets.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The DL-based model developed for this study was able to detect all breast cancers with a very low mFPI. Our DL-based model achieved the highest performance to date, which might lead to improved diagnosis for breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Background: Breast cancer, behind skin cancer, is the second most frequent malignancy among women, initiated by an unregulated cell division in breast tissues. Although early mammogram screening and treatment result in decreased mortality, differentiating cancer cells from surrounding tissues are often fallible, resulting in fallacious diagnosis. Method: The mammography dataset is used to categorize breast cancer into four classes with low computational complexity, introducing a feature extraction-based approach with machine learning (ML) algorithms. After artefact removal and the preprocessing of the mammograms, the dataset is augmented with seven augmentation techniques. The region of interest (ROI) is extracted by employing several algorithms including a dynamic thresholding method. Sixteen geometrical features are extracted from the ROI while eleven ML algorithms are investigated with these features. Three ensemble models are generated from these ML models employing the stacking method where the first ensemble model is built by stacking ML models with an accuracy of over 90\% and the accuracy thresholds for generating the rest of the ensemble models are {\textgreater}95\% and {\textgreater}96. Five feature selection methods with fourteen configurations are applied to notch up the performance. Results: The Random Forest Importance algorithm, with a threshold of 0.045, produces 10 features that acquired the highest performance with 98.05\% test accuracy by stacking Random Forest and XGB classifier, having a higher than {\textgreater}96\% accuracy. Furthermore, with K-fold cross-validation, consistent performance is observed across all K values ranging from 3–30. Moreover, the proposed strategy combining image processing, feature extraction and ML has a proven high accuracy in classifying breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Digital mammogram has become the most effective technique for early breast cancer detection modality. Digital mammogram takes an electronic image of the breast and stores it directly in a computer. High quality mammogram images are high resolution and large size images. Processing these images require high computational capabilities. The transmission of these images over the net is sometimes critical especially if the diagnosis of remote radiologists is required. The aim of this study is to develop an automated system for assisting the analysis of digital mammograms. Computer image processing techniques will be applied to enhance images and this is followed by segmentation of the region of interest (ROI). Subsequently, the textural features will be extracted from the ROI. The texture features will be used to classify the ROIs as either masses or non-masses.},

	abstract = {Research in the medical imaging ﬁeld using deep learning approaches has become progressively contingent. Scientiﬁc ﬁndings reveal that supervised deep learning methods’ performance heavily depends on training set size, which expert radiologists must manually annotate. The latter is quite a tiring and time-consuming task. Therefore, most of the freely accessible biomedical image datasets are small-sized. Furthermore, it is challenging to have big-sized medical image datasets due to privacy and legal issues. Consequently, not a small number of supervised deep learning models are prone to overﬁtting and cannot produce generalized output. One of the most popular methods to mitigate the issue above goes under the name of data augmentation. This technique helps increase training set size by utilizing various transformations and has been publicized to improve the model performance when tested on new data. This article surveyed different data augmentation techniques employed on mammogram images. The article aims to provide insights into basic and deep learning-based augmentation techniques.},

To this end, Deep Learning models are increasingly used in the classiﬁcation and segmentation of histopathological images, as they obtain high accuracy index and can help specialists.

In this paper, a comparative study of different preprocessing methods and deep learning models for a set of breast cancer images is presented. For this purpose, the statistical test ANOVA with data obtained from the performance of ﬁve different deep learning models is analyzed. An important conclusion from this test can be obtained; from the point of view of the accuracy of the system, the main repercussion is the deep learning models used, however, the ﬁlter used for the preprocessing of the image, has no statistical signiﬁcance for the behavior of the system.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06807},
	abstract = {Deep feedforward and recurrent networks have achieved impressive results in many perception and language processing applications. This success is partially attributed to architectural innovations such as convolutional and long short-term memory networks. The main motivation for these architectural innovations is that they capture better domain knowledge, and importantly are easier to optimize than more basic architectures. Recently, more complex architectures such as Neural Turing Machines and Memory Networks have been proposed for tasks including question answering and general computation, creating a new set of optimization challenges. In this paper, we discuss a low-overhead and easy-to-implement technique of adding gradient noise which we find to be surprisingly effective when training these very deep architectures. The technique not only helps to avoid overfitting, but also can result in lower training loss. This method alone allows a fully-connected 20-layer deep network to be trained with standard gradient descent, even starting from a poor initialization. We see consistent improvements for many complex models, including a 72\% relative reduction in error rate over a carefully-tuned baseline on a challenging question-answering task, and a doubling of the number of accurate binary multiplication models learned across 7,000 random restarts. We encourage further application of this technique to additional complex modern architectures.},

	abstract = {It is well known that the addition of noise to the input data of a neural network during training can, in some circumstances, lead to significant improvements in generalization performance. Previous work has shown that such training with noise is equivalent to a form of regularization in which an extra term is added to the error function. However, the regularization term, which involves second derivatives of the error function, is not bounded below, and so can lead to difficulties if used directly in a learning algorithm based on error minimization. In this paper we show that for the purposes of network training, the regularization term can be reduced to a positive semi-definite form that involves only first derivatives of the network mapping. For a sum-of-squares error function, the regularization term belongs to the class of generalized Tikhonov regularizers. Direct minimization of the regularized error function provides a practical alternative to training with noise.},

	abstract = {Perforin-2 (MPEG1) is an effector of the innate immune system that limits the proliferation and spread of medically relevant Gram-negative, -positive, and acid fast bacteria. We show here that a cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complex containing cullin-1 and βTrCP monoubiquitylates Perforin-2 in response to pathogen associated molecular patterns such as LPS. Ubiquitylation triggers a rapid redistribution of Perforin-2 and is essential for its bactericidal activity. Enteric pathogens such as Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli disarm host cells by injecting cell cycle inhibiting factors (Cifs) into mammalian cells to deamidate the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8. Because CRL activity is dependent upon NEDD8, Cif blocks ubiquitin dependent trafficking of Perforin-2 and thus, its bactericidal activity. Collectively, these studies further underscore the biological significance of Perforin-2 and elucidate critical molecular events that culminate in Perforin-2-dependent killing of both intracellular and extracellular, cell-adherent bacteria.
          , 
            A wide range of bacteria and other microbes can infect animals and cause disease. Throughout evolution, these microbes and their hosts have been fighting never ending arms races in which the microbes deploy ever more elaborate weapons, while the hosts adapt to defend themselves. An animal's first line of defense is provided by its ‘innate’ immune system. This system is activated by the general features of microbial cells; for example, the molecules that make up the walls surrounding most bacteria. Microbes must defeat the innate immune system in order to cause disease, and ultimately to spread from one host to the next.
            One component of innate immunity is a protein called Perforin-2 that is present in most, if not all, animal cells. This protein forms pores on bacterial cells, causing them to split open and die. However, it was not clear how Perforin-2 is switched on and what, if anything, bacteria do to counteract it. To address these questions, McCormack et al. infected human and mice cells with bacteria that cause serious diseases of the digestive tract.
            The experiments show that when animal cells detect bacteria, or merely a fragment of their cell wall, a specific group of proteins, called the CRL complex, attaches a molecule called ubiquitin to Perforin-2. Ubiquitin works much like the shipping label of a package, enabling the efficient targeting of Perforin-2 to the invading bacteria. McCormack et al. also show that some bacteria use a protein called a cell cycle inhibiting factor (or Cif for short) to inhibit the CRL complex. This blocks the ubiquitin labeling of Perforin-2, which renders it a useless weapon that can no longer be directed towards bacteria.
            Mice that are infected with a bacterium called Yersinia pseudotuberculosis become seriously unwell and often die. However, McCormack et al. found that mice infected with mutant Y. pseudotuberculosis that lacked Cif remained healthy. Also, mice that lacked Perforin-2 are highly susceptible to infectious diseases. McCormack et al.'s findings reveal how Perforin-2 is activated during the innate immune response and how some bacteria can defeat this pivotal defense. In the current age of antibiotic resistant bacteria, these studies may spur the development of new drugs that restore or increase the activity of Perforin-2.},

In training, Random Erasing randomly selects a rectangle region in an image and erases its pixels with random values. In this process, training images with various levels of occlusion are generated, which reduces the risk of over-fitting and makes the model robust to occlusion. Random Erasing is parameter learning free, easy to implement, and can be integrated with most of the CNN-based recognition models. Albeit simple, Random Erasing is complementary to commonly used data augmentation techniques such as random cropping and flipping, and yields consistent improvement over strong baselines in image classification, object detection and person re-identification.

              This paper presents a novel machine learning approach to perform an early prediction of the healthcare cost of breast cancer patients. The learning phase of our prediction method considers the following two steps: (1) in the first step, the patients are clustered taking into account the sequences of actions undergoing similar clinical activities and ensuring similar healthcare costs, and (2) a Markov chain is then learned for each group to describe the action-sequences of the patients in the cluster. A two step procedure is undertaken in the prediction phase: (1) first, the healthcare cost of a new patient’s treatment is estimated based on the average healthcare cost of its
              k
              -nearest neighbors in each group, and (2) finally, an aggregate measure of the healthcare cost estimated by each group is used as the final predicted cost.
 Experiments undertaken reveal a mean absolute percentage error as small as 6\%, even when half of the clinical records of a patient is available, substantiating the early prediction capability of the proposed method. Comparative analysis substantiates the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art techniques.},

	abstract = {In molecular biology, just as in many other fields of science, data often come in the form of matrices or contingency tables with many observations (rows) for a set of variables (columns). While projection methods like principal component analysis or correspondence analysis (CA) can be applied for obtaining an overview of such data, in cases where the matrix is very large the associated loss of information upon projection into two or three dimensions may be dramatic. However, when the set of variables can be grouped into clusters, this opens up a new angle on the data. We focus on the question of which observations are associated to a cluster and distinguish it from other clusters. CA employs a geometry geared towards answering this question. We exploit this feature in order to introduce Association Plots for visualizing cluster-specific observations in complex data. Regardless of the data matrix dimensionality Association Plots are two-dimensional and depict the observations associated to a cluster of variables. We demonstrate our method on two small data sets and then use it to study a challenging genomic data set comprising {\textgreater}10,000 samples. We show that Association Plots can clearly highlight those observations which characterise a cluster of variables.},

Goodness of fit techniques is based on measuring in some way the conformity of the sample data to the hypothesized distribution or equivalently, its discrepancy from it. The techniques usually give formal statistical tests and the data based measures of conformity or discrepancy are referred to as test statistics. In this paper we have studied the performance of the bootstrap based procedure of EDF based tests for testing the goodness of fit for normality of the distribution using simulation technique.

This study addresses the performance of 50 normality tests available in literature, from 1900 until 2018. Because a theoretical comparison is not possible, Monte Carlo simulation were used from various symmetric and asymmetric distributions for diﬀerent sample sizes ranging from 10 to 100. The simulations results show that for symmetric distributions with support on (−∞, ∞) the tests Robust Jarque–Bera and Gel–Miao–Gastwirth have generally the most power. For asymmetric distributions with support on (−∞, ∞) the tests 1st Cabana-Cabana and 2nd Zhang-Wu have the most power.

While testing the GoF of a simple (point) null hypothesis provides an analyst great ﬂexibility in the choice of test statistic while still ensuring validity, most GoF tests for composite null hypotheses are far more constrained, as the test statistic must have a tractable distribution over the entire null model space. A notable exception is co-suﬃcient sampling (CSS): resampling the data conditional on a suﬃcient statistic for the null model guarantees valid GoF testing using any test statistic the analyst chooses. But CSS testing requires the null model to have a compact (in an information-theoretic sense) suﬃcient statistic, which only holds for a very limited class of models; even for a null model as simple as logistic regression, CSS testing is powerless. In this paper, we leverage the concept of approximate suﬃciency to generalize CSS testing to essentially any parametric model with an asymptotically-eﬃcient estimator; we call our extension “approximate CSS” (aCSS) testing. We quantify the ﬁnite-sample Type I error inﬂation of aCSS testing and show that it is vanishing under standard maximum likelihood asymptotics, for any choice of test statistic. We apply our proposed procedure both theoretically and in simulation to a number of models of interest to demonstrate its ﬁnite-sample Type I error and power.},

Meeting that objective requires to carry out a testing procedure for a problem in which the statement that the deviations between model and true distribution are small, plays the role of the alternative hypothesis. Testing procedures of this kind, for which the term tests for equivalence has been coined in statistical usage, are available for establishing goodness-of-fit of discrete distributions.

The optimized outlier detection ensembles consist of outlier detection algorithms, which provide an outlier score and utilize adjustable parameters. The automatic optimization determines the parameter values, which enhance the discrimination of inliers and outliers. This increases the efﬁciency of the outlier detection. Outliers are rare by deﬁnition, which makes the optimization with a few examples beneﬁcial. Obtaining examples of outliers can be prohibitively challenging, and the outlier examples should be used efﬁciently.},

Albeit convex, the learning problem can be hard as the time series accumulate. In this regards, an efﬁcient randomized block coordinate descent (RBCD) algorithm is proposed. The model and the algorithm is tested with a real-world application, involving outlier detection and event analysis in power distribution networks with high resolution multi-stream measurements.

Most such applications are high dimensional domains in which the data can contain hundreds of dimensions. Many recent algorithms use concepts of proximity in order to nd outliers based on their relationship to the rest of the data. However, in high dimensional space, the data is sparse and the notion of proximity fails to retain its meaningfulness. In fact, the sparsity of high dimensional data implies that every point is an almost equally good outlier from the perspective of proximity-based de nitions. Consequently, for high dimensional data, the notion of nding meaningful outliers becomes substantially more complex and non-obvious.

	abstract = {The relative power of goodness-of-fit test statistics has long been debated in the literature. Chi-Square type test statistics to determine 'fit' for categorical data are still dominant in the goodness-of-fit arena. Empirical Distribution Function type goodness-of-fit test statistics are known to be relatively more powerful than Chi-Square type test statistics for restricted types of null and alternative distributions. In many practical applications researchers who use a standard Chi-Square type goodness-of-fit test statistic ignore the rank of ordinal classes. This thesis reviews literature in the goodness-of-fit field, with major emphasis on categorical goodness-of-fit tests. The continued use of an asymptotic distribution to approximate the exact distribution of categorical goodness-of-fit test statistics is discouraged. It is unlikely that an asymptotic distribution will produce a more accurate estimation of the exact distribution of a goodness-of-fit test statistic than a Monte Carlo approximation with a large number of simulations. Due to their relatively higher powers for restricted types of null and alternative distributions, several authors recommend the use of Empirical Distribution Function test statistics over nominal goodness-of-fit test statistics such as Pearson's Chi-Square. In-depth power studies confirm the views of other authors that categorical Empirical Distribution Function type test statistics do not have higher power for some common null and alternative distributions. Because of this, it is not sensible to make a conclusive recommendation to always use an Empirical Distribution Function type test statistic instead of a nominal goodness-of-fit test statistic. Traditionally the recommendation to determine 'fit' for multivariate categorical data is to treat categories as nominal, an approach which precludes any gain in power which may accrue from a ranking, should one or more variables be ordinal. The presence of multiple criteria through multivariate data may result in partially ordered categories, some of which have equal ranking. This thesis proposes a modification to the currently available Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistics for ordinal and nominal categorical data to account for situations of partially ordered categories. The new test statistic, called the Combined Kolmogorov-Smirnov, is relatively more powerful than Pearson's Chi-Square and the nominal Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic for some null and alternative distributions. A recommendation is made to use the new test statistic with higher power in situations where some benefit can be achieved by incorporating an Empirical Distribution Function approach, but the data lack a complete natural ordering of categories. The new and established categorical goodness-of-fit test statistics are demonstrated in the analysis of categorical data with brief applications as diverse as familiarity of defence programs, the number of recruits produced by the Merlin bird, a demographic problem, and DNA profiling of genotypes. The results from these applications confirm the recommendations associated with specific goodness-of-fit test statistics throughout this thesis.},

While there are several common similarity measures for continuous data, there is little work for categorical data. Most approaches are purely datadriven and don’t consider the inherent dependencies of complex domains such as geological structures, phylogenetics, etc. We propose two new similarity measures that take into account semantic information to calculate the similarity between two categorical values. Semantic information is represented as a hierarchy extracted from an ontology or a domain taxonomy. The ﬁrst approach calculates semantic similarity by combining the data-driven approach with the hierarchy imposed on the possible categorical values. The second approach ignores the data and uses only the hierarchy to calculate semantic similarity. We apply our methods to a speciﬁc complex data mining task in the oil and gas industry: reservoir analogue identiﬁcation. The two proposed measures are compared to existing data-based measures.},

Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of “normal” examples with only a small percentage of “abnormal” or “interesting” examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classiﬁer to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classiﬁer performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classiﬁer performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classiﬁer. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.},

We try to put the population into series of homogeneous groups and by this, the precision will be increased. When the population of interest can be divided into k homogeneous groups and the sample of observation is taken from each group, we have a stratified random sample and each group is called a stratum. The study was therefore designed to investigate the efficiency of Neyman allocation procedure over equal and proportional allocations. The data used for this research were primary data collected from ten Markets in Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria on the prices of Peak Milk (Nigeria made). A stratified random sampling scheme was used in selecting 10 markets in Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria. Each market stands as a stratum. From each stratum, independent sample was selected randomly based on equal, proportional and Neyman/Optimum allocation procedures. Statistic was obtained from each stratum and combined estimate of the separate statistic was also obtained for each of the allocation procedure. Considering the analysis and estimates obtained, the mean and variance under Neyman allocation procedure were 1356.672 and 21.45 respectively. For proportional allocation, the mean was 1349.3069 and variance was 38.98 while equal allocation gave mean of 1352 and variance of 170.3238. Neyman/Optimum allocation procedure gave the least variance. This was followed by Proportional allocation and Equal allocation. Neyman allocation procedure is the best selection procedure. Hence, for estimating the average and the variance of the prices of Peak Milk (Nigeria Made) in the markets in Abeokuta, of all the three sample allocation procedures considered in this paper, Neyman allocation procedure is the best and hence the most efficient.},

	abstract = {Numerous optimization problems arise in survey designs. The problem of obtaining an optimal (or near optimal) sampling design can be formulated and solved as a mathematical programming problem. In multivariate stratiﬁed sample surveys usually it is not possible to use the individual optimum allocations for sample sizes to various strata for one reason or another. In such situations some criterion is needed to work out an allocation which is optimum for all characteristics in some sense. Such an allocation may be called an optimum compromise allocation. This paper examines the problem of determining an optimum compromise allocation in multivariate stratiﬁed random sampling, when the population means of several characteristics are to be estimated. Formulating the problem of allocation as an all integer nonlinear programming problem, the paper develops a solution procedure using a dynamic programming technique. The compromise allocation discussed is optimal in the sense that it minimizes a weighted sum of the sampling variances of the estimates of the population means of various characteristics under study. A numerical example illustrates the solution procedure and shows how it compares with Cochran’s average allocation and proportional allocation.},

So an allocation called “Compromise allocation” is to be worked out suggested by Cochran.

Moreover, for practical implementation of an allocation, we need integer values of the sample sizes. In the present paper the problem is to determine the integer optimum compromise allocation when the population means of various characteristics are of interest and auxiliary information is available for the separate and combined ratio and regression estimates. This paper considers the optimum compromise allocation in multivariate stratified sampling with non-linear objective function and probabilistic non-linear cost constraint. The probabilistic non-linear cost constraint is converted into equivalent deterministic one by using Chance Constrained programming. The formulated multi-objective nonlinear programming problem is solved by Fuzzy Goal programming approach and Chebyshev approximation. Numerical illustration is also given to show the practical utility of the approaches.},

If a sampling frame is available, containing auxiliary information related to each unit (the X’s), it is possible to adopt a stratiﬁed sample design. For any given stratiﬁcation of the frame, in the multivariate case it is possible to solve the problem of the best allocation of units in strata, by minimizing a cost function subject to precision constraints (or, conversely, by maximizing the precision of the estimates under a given budget). The problem is to determine the best stratiﬁcation in the frame, i.e., the one that ensures the overall minimal cost of the sample necessary to satisfy precision constraints. The X’s can be categorical or continuous; continuous ones can be transformed into categorical ones. The most detailed stratiﬁcation is given by the Cartesian product of the X’s (the atomic strata). A way to determine the best stratiﬁcation is to explore exhaustively the set of all possible partitions derivable by the set of atomic strata, evaluating each one by calculating the corresponding cost in terms of the sample required to satisfy precision constraints. This is unaﬀordable in practical situations, where the dimension of the space of the partitions can be very high. Another possible way is to explore the space of partitions with an algorithm that is particularly suitable in such situations: the genetic algorithm. The R package SamplingStrata, based on the use of a genetic algorithm, allows to determine the best stratiﬁcation for a population frame, i.e., the one that ensures the minimum sample cost necessary to satisfy precision constraints, in a multivariate and multi-domain case.},

These two objectives, however, cannot always be achieved simultaneously. Existing PPS schemes prioritize control of the sample size, violating the PPS property if necessary. We provide a new PPS scheme that allows a different trade-off: our method enforces the PPS property at all times while ensuring that the sample size never exceeds the target value n. The sample size is exactly equal to n if possible, and otherwise has maximal expected value and minimal variance. Thus we bound the sample size, thereby avoiding storage overﬂows and helping to control the time required for analytics over the sample, while allowing the user complete control over the sample contents. The method is both simple to implement and efﬁcient, being a one-pass streaming algorithm with an amortized processing time of O(1) per item.},

In the statistical analysis of those massive data sets, sampling generally plays a very important role. In this work, we describe a scalable simple random sampling algorithm, named ScaSRS, which uses probabilistic thresholds to decide on the ﬂy whether to accept, reject, or wait-list an item independently of others. We prove, with hig√h probability, it succeeds and needs only O( k) storage, where k is the sample size. ScaSRS extends naturally to a scalable stratiﬁed sampling algorithm, which is favorable for heterogeneous data sets. The proposed algorithms, when implemented in MapReduce, can eﬀectively reduce the size of intermediate output and greatly improve load balancing. Empirical evaluation on large-scale data sets clearly demonstrates their superiority.},

HADI, American University in Cairo, Egypt, and Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA. ahadi@aucegypt.edu or ali-hadi@cornell.edu Anomaly detection has numerous applications in diverse fields. For example, it has been widely used for discovering network intrusions and malicious events. It has also been used in numerous other applications such as identifying medical malpractice or credit fraud. Detection of anomalies in quantitative data has received a considerable attention in the literature and has a venerable history. By contrast, and despite the widespread availability use of categorical data in practice, anomaly detection in categorical data has received relatively little attention as compared to quantitative data. This is because detection of anomalies in categorical data is a challenging problem. Some anomaly detection techniques depend on identifying a representative pattern then measuring distances between objects and this pattern. Objects that are far from this pattern are declared as anomalies. However, identifying patterns and measuring distances are not easy in categorical data compared with quantitative data. Fortunately, several papers focussing on the detection of anomalies in categorical data have been published in the recent literature. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the research on the anomaly detection problem in categorical data. Previous review articles focus on either the statistics literature or the machine learning and computer science literature. This review article combines both literatures. We review 36 methods for the detection of anomalies in categorical data in both literatures and classify them into 12 different categories based on the conceptual definition of anomalies they use. For each approach, we survey anomaly detection methods, and then show the similarities and differences among them. We emphasize two important issues, the number of parameters each method requires and its time complexity. The first issue is critical because the performance of these methods are sensitive to the choice of these parameters. The time complexity is also very important in real applications especially in big data applications. We report the time complexity if it is reported by the authors of the methods. If not we derive it ourselves and report it in this paper. In addition, we discuss the common problems and the future directions of the anomaly detection in categorical data.

	abstract = {Recommender systems have become ubiquitous in our digital lives, from recommending products on e-commerce websites to suggesting movies and music on streaming platforms. Existing recommendation datasets, such as Amazon Product Reviews and MovieLens, greatly facilitated the research and development of recommender systems in their respective domains. While the number of mobile users and applications (aka apps) has increased exponentially over the past decade, research in mobile app recommender systems has been significantly constrained, primarily due to the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets, as opposed to recommendations for products, movies, and news. To facilitate research for app recommendation systems, we introduce a large-scale dataset, called MobileRec. We constructed MobileRec from users' activity on the Google play store. MobileRec contains 19.3 million user interactions (i.e., user reviews on apps) with over 10K unique apps across 48 categories. MobileRec records the sequential activity of a total of 0.7 million distinct users. Each of these users has interacted with no fewer than five distinct apps, which stands in contrast to previous datasets on mobile apps that recorded only a single interaction per user. Furthermore, MobileRec presents users' ratings as well as sentiments on installed apps, and each app contains rich metadata such as app name, category, description, and overall rating, among others. We demonstrate that MobileRec can serve as an excellent testbed for app recommendation through a comparative study of several state-of-the-art recommendation approaches. The quantitative results can act as a baseline for other researchers to compare their results against. The MobileRec dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/recmeapp/mobilerec.},

However, a great number of app reviews vary in quality and reliability. It is a difficult and time-consuming challenge to analyze app reviews using manual methods. To address this, a novel approach is proposed as an automated method to predict high priority user requests with fourteen extracted features. A semi-automated approach is applied to annotate requirements with high or low priority with the help of app changelogs. Reviews from six apps were retrieved from the Apple App Store to evaluate the feasibility of the approach and interpret the principles. The performance comparison results of the approach greatly exceed the IDEA method, with an average precision of 75.4\% and recall of 70.4\%. Our approach can be applied to specific app development to assist app developers in quickly locating user requirements and implement app maintenance and evolution.},

            App reviews found in app stores can provide critically valuable information to help software engineers understand user requirements and to design, debug, and evolve software products. Over the last ten years, a vast amount of research has been produced to study what useful information might be found in app reviews, and how to mine and organise such information as efficiently as possible. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of this research, covering 182 papers published between 2012 and 2020. This survey classifies app review analysis not only in terms of mined information and applied data mining techniques but also, and most importantly, in terms of supported software engineering activities. The survey also reports on the quality and results of empirical evaluation of existing techniques and identifies important avenues for further research. This survey can be of interest to researchers and commercial organisations developing app review analysis techniques and to software engineers considering to use app review analysis.},

	abstract = {The rapid and wide proliferation of mobile phones has led to accelerated demand for mobile applications (apps). Consequently, a large number of mobile apps have been developed and deployed on the Google and Apple Play stores. Calling apps hold special importance in this regard by offering the services of sharing messages, making video calls, and sending audio messages, free of cost. Although each app has its own set of features, different apps can provide higher levels of satisfaction for the user, and aspect analysis is often overlooked by existing studies. This study presents an aspect-level analysis of IMO, Skype, Telegram, WeChat, and WhatsApp regarding the services offered for the account, app, call, message, update, video, and working features. A large collected dataset from the Google Play store is utilized for aspect extraction and analysis using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. Apps are analyzed using LDA-extracted aspects and recommended regarding users’ priorities of call, message, and video requirements. Sentiment analysis is adopted to analyze user sentiments regarding apps as well as to aid in the aspect analysis. For sentiment analysis, a novel ensemble model of a gated recurrent unit and convolutional neural network is presented, which obtains a 94\% accuracy score.},
