    "2. Data Quality Analysis: Assess quality and suitability of the data in terms of missing values, outliers, duplication, cardinality, and feature values.\n",
    "3. Univariate Analysis: Explore the distributions of rating count, average rating, categories, and price.\n",
    "4. Bivariate Analysis: Evaluate ratings, rating count, reviews and correlation analysis between two variables.\n",
    "5. Multivariate Analysis: Cluster, factor, and correspondence analysis of three or more variables simultaneously.\n",
    "6. Conclusions, insights and questions for stage two."
